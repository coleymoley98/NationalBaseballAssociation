"He changes speed, gives different looks to different hitters. When he's on his game, he's quite a handful."<br><br>In the contest, the Kelowna right-hander rang up 13 and surrendered 1 walk.<br><br>"He didn't give us any second chances," said Broncos manager <a href="../coaches/coach_520.html">Rudy Seguro</a>.
