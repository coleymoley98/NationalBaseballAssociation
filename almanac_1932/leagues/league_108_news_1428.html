"Three or four is better, but five or more is out of sight. And to do that at the Western League-level is really something special." <br><br>The 21-year-old player earned his accolades today at Ballpark of Seattle with a spectacular 5-for-7 game against the Rainiers. <br><br>"His swing is getting there," said Coyotes skipper Peerapong Owens, who spoke glowingly of <a href="../players/player_7746.html">Vilain</a> after the game. "We want him to be quick with his swing, short and compact.
