That put him in a very select group of pitchers.<br><br>He joined that exclusive club today at Sportsmans Park 1911 by whipping the <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia Liberty</a> 4-2, holding them to 7 hits in 5.2 innings while chalking up 1 strikeout and 4 walks.<br><br>In the postgame interview, the modest Dionne said, "It's special to win 100 games. You don't do it by yourself. You do it with good stuff and a good bullpen. You are only as good as the guys behind you. Years from now I might look back on it and give myself a little pat on the back."<br><br>Lifetime <a href="../players/player_2687.html">Dionne</a> has a won-lost record of 100 victories and 102 losses with 674 strikeouts in 1819.1 innings and a 3.56 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_141.html">View Boxscore</a> </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Dionne%20Beats%20Liberty%20for%20100th%20Win&news=His%20goal%20at%20twenty%20was%20to%20win%20twenty%20games%20one%20year%2C%20pitch%20until%20he%20was%20thirty%2C%20win%20the%20league%20pennant%20and%20to%20make%20some%20money%2E%20Well%2C%20Maurice%20Dionne%20did%20something%20even%20better%20%2D%2D%20the%2036%2Dyear%2Dold%20Baltimore%20Robins%20star%20has%20now%20won%20100%20games%20in%20his%20career%2E%20That%20put%20him%20in%20a%20very%20select%20group%20of%20pitchers%2E%0A%0AHe%20joined%20that%20exclusive%20club%20today%20at%20Sportsmans%20Park%201911%20by%20whipping%20the%20Philadelphia%20Liberty%204%2D2%2C%20holding%20them%20to%207%20hits%20in%205%2E2%20innings%20while%20chalking%20up%201%20strikeout%20and%204%20walks%2E%0A%0AIn%20the%20postgame%20interview%2C%20the%20modest%20Dionne%20said%2C%20%22It%27s%20special%20to%20win%20100%20games%2E%20You%20don%27t%20do%20it%20by%20yourself%2E%20You%20do%20it%20with%20good%20stuff%20and%20a%20good%20bullpen%2E%20You%20are%20only%20as%20good%20as%20the%20guys%20behind%20you%2E%20Years%20from%20now%20I%20might%20look%20back%20on%20it%20and%20give%20myself%20a%20little%20pat%20on%20the%20back%2E%22%0A%0ALifetime%20Dionne%20has%20a%20won%2Dlost%20record%20of%20100%20victories%20and%20102%20losses%20with%20674%20strikeouts%20in%201819%2E1%20innings%20and%20a%203%2E56%20ERA%2E%0A%0AView%20Boxscore%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
