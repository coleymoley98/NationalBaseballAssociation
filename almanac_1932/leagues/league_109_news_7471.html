McClellan</a> was feeling calm about his no-hitter -- until the last three outs.<br><br>"You really become conscious of every pitch at that point," he said. "The adrenaline level kicks up even higher. Everybody in the ballpark knows a no-hitter is on the line. The crowd is on its feet. One mistake and it's all over."<br><br>There were no mistakes to be had for McClellan on this day at Ballpark of Hamilton. The <a href="../teams/team_152.html">Sherbrooke Nordiques</a> right-hander was in complete command, not allowing the <a href="../teams/team_147.html">Hamilton Blue Sox</a> a single base hit in the 6-0 victory.<br><br>"Obviously, you never think this will happen," he said to BNN reporters after the game. "I don't know if it's really sunk in yet."<br><br>McClellan faced 30 batters, had 10 strikeouts and gave up 3 walks in a dominating effort.<br><br>"He was on from the get-go," Blue Sox manager <a href="../coaches/coach_313.html">Newin Prariwanta</a> said.
