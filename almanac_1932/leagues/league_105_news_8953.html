"These guys can be very competitive," said Verreault. "Sometimes they just have a lapse in judgment and take it a little too far." According to teammates who witnessed the race, Boudreau and Van Buren made a small wager on who could run from second base to the outfield wall the fastest. Apparently, Boudreau was in the lead when, about 20 feet from the "finish line", he suddenly pulled up lame. Boudreau immediately complained of having a sore heel and had to be helped back to the clubhouse. Although tests were negative, Boudreau is likely to miss at least a week of action. "I have to tell these guys all the time to save it for the games," said Verreault, who indicated he may fine or suspend players for similar behavior in the future. "Hopefully, this time they've learned their lesson." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Boudreau%20Injured%20While%20Racing%20Teammate&news=Chicagou%20teammates%20Kritsana%20Boudreau%20and%20Elijah%20Van%20Buren%20are%20in%20hot%20water%20with%20manager%20Daniel%20Verreault%20after%20an%20impromptu%20foot%20race%20resulted%20in%20an%20injury%20to%20Boudreau%2E%20%22These%20guys%20can%20be%20very%20competitive%2C%22%20said%20Verreault%2E%20%22Sometimes%20they%20just%20have%20a%20lapse%20in%20judgment%20and%20take%20it%20a%20little%20too%20far%2E%22%20According%20to%20teammates%20who%20witnessed%20the%20race%2C%20Boudreau%20and%20Van%20Buren%20made%20a%20small%20wager%20on%20who%20could%20run%20from%20second%20base%20to%20the%20outfield%20wall%20the%20fastest%2E%20Apparently%2C%20Boudreau%20was%20in%20the%20lead%20when%2C%20about%2020%20feet%20from%20the%20%22finish%20line%22%2C%20he%20suddenly%20pulled%20up%20lame%2E%20Boudreau%20immediately%20complained%20of%20having%20a%20sore%20heel%20and%20had%20to%20be%20helped%20back%20to%20the%20clubhouse%2E%20Although%20tests%20were%20negative%2C%20Boudreau%20is%20likely%20to%20miss%20at%20least%20a%20week%20of%20action%2E%20%22I%20have%20to%20tell%20these%20guys%20all%20the%20time%20to%20save%20it%20for%20the%20games%2C%22%20said%20Verreault%2C%20who%20indicated%20he%20may%20fine%20or%20suspend%20players%20for%20similar%20behavior%20in%20the%20future%2E%20%22Hopefully%2C%20this%20time%20they%27ve%20learned%20their%20lesson%2E%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
