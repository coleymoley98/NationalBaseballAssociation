His day of glory wasn't able to win the game, however. The <a href="../teams/team_80.html">New Britain Yankees</a> got the 4-2 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_87.html">Sherbrooke Canadiens</a>.<br><br>"I never realized that a few hits could cause so much commotion," the second baseman said in the clubhouse after the game, crowded by reporters. "Headlines and highlights are great, but it takes a lot of luster off it that we lost."<br><br>After his first couple of hits, all eyes in the ballpark were on him each time <a href="../players/player_3930.html">Michaud</a> stepped into the batter's box. Even some opposing fans were pulling for him, knowing they were watching a little slice of baseball history unfold. <br><br>When asked what the secret of hitting so well is, he smiled and said "relax, concentrate, and hit the ball where they ain't." <br><br>That's exactly what he did today, as Michaud finished the game with 5 hits in 5 at-bats and a line in the record book. <a href="../players/player_3930.html">Eliot Michaud</a> hit a two-run double in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_3930.html">Michaud</a> is batting .371 with 21 RBIs, 15 runs scored and 1 home run. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Hits%20Galore%3A%20Michaud%20Drills%205%20Hits&news=Eliot%20Michaud%20was%20on%20quite%20a%20roll%20today%20as%20he%20knocked%20the%20ball%20all%20over%20Field%20of%20the%20Juniors%2C%20collecting%205%20hits%2E%20His%20day%20of%20glory%20wasn%27t%20able%20to%20win%20the%20game%2C%20however%2E%20The%20New%20Britain%20Yankees%20got%20the%204%2D2%20victory%20over%20the%20Sherbrooke%20Canadiens%2E%0A%0A%22I%20never%20realized%20that%20a%20few%20hits%20could%20cause%20so%20much%20commotion%2C%22%20the%20second%20baseman%20said%20in%20the%20clubhouse%20after%20the%20game%2C%20crowded%20by%20reporters%2E%20%22Headlines%20and%20highlights%20are%20great%2C%20but%20it%20takes%20a%20lot%20of%20luster%20off%20it%20that%20we%20lost%2E%22%0A%0AAfter%20his%20first%20couple%20of%20hits%2C%20all%20eyes%20in%20the%20ballpark%20were%20on%20him%20each%20time%20Michaud%20stepped%20into%20the%20batter%27s%20box%2E%20Even%20some%20opposing%20fans%20were%20pulling%20for%20him%2C%20knowing%20they%20were%20watching%20a%20little%20slice%20of%20baseball%20history%20unfold%2E%20%0A%0AWhen%20asked%20what%20the%20secret%20of%20hitting%20so%20well%20is%2C%20he%20smiled%20and%20said%20%22relax%2C%20concentrate%2C%20and%20hit%20the%20ball%20where%20they%20ain%27t%2E%22%20%0A%0AThat%27s%20exactly%20what%20he%20did%20today%2C%20as%20Michaud%20finished%20the%20game%20with%205%20hits%20in%205%20at%2Dbats%20and%20a%20line%20in%20the%20record%20book%2E%20Eliot%20Michaud%20hit%20a%20two%2Drun%20double%20in%20the%201st%2C%20singled%20in%20the%203rd%2C%20singled%20in%20the%205th%2C%20singled%20in%20the%207th%20and%20singled%20in%20the%209th%2E%0A%0AThis%20season%20Michaud%20is%20batting%20%2E371%20with%2021%20RBIs%2C%2015%20runs%20scored%20and%201%20home%20run%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
