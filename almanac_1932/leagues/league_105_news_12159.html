I've been cheering this team on since I was a little kid, and I still live about 20 minutes from the ballpark. I remember coming to the stadium with my dad and just enjoying being at the games with him," said <a href="../players/player_5948.html">Phomee</a>. "Now I finally have a chance to give back and help bring a championship to the team that I loved so much growing up. I'm really excited for this opportunity. There's no negative I can think of to signing with New York, The United Provinces. All positives so far, and I hope it stays that way." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Bunnawat%20Phomee%20Comes%20Home&news=It%20is%20many%20a%20child%27s%20dream%20to%20play%20for%20their%20hometown%20team%2C%20and%20Bunnawat%20Phomee%20has%20finally%20achieved%20that%20dream%20after%20signing%20a%20contract%20with%20the%20New%20York%2E%0A%0AAt%20his%20press%20conference%2C%20one%20reporter%20asked%20how%20he%20felt%20about%20joining%20the%20Canadian%20League%20East%20team%2E%0A%0A%22It%27s%20a%20dream%20come%20true%2E%20I%27ve%20been%20cheering%20this%20team%20on%20since%20I%20was%20a%20little%20kid%2C%20and%20I%20still%20live%20about%2020%20minutes%20from%20the%20ballpark%2E%20I%20remember%20coming%20to%20the%20stadium%20with%20my%20dad%20and%20just%20enjoying%20being%20at%20the%20games%20with%20him%2C%22%20said%20Phomee%2E%20%22Now%20I%20finally%20have%20a%20chance%20to%20give%20back%20and%20help%20bring%20a%20championship%20to%20the%20team%20that%20I%20loved%20so%20much%20growing%20up%2E%20I%27m%20really%20excited%20for%20this%20opportunity%2E%20There%27s%20no%20negative%20I%20can%20think%20of%20to%20signing%20with%20New%20York%2C%20The%20United%20Provinces%2E%20All%20positives%20so%20far%2C%20and%20I%20hope%20it%20stays%20that%20way%2E%22"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
