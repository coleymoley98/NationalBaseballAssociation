He thought he got the worst deal and told the league commissioner, "In any fight, whoever throws the first punch should get a more severe penalty. If I threw the first punch, I'd expect to get the most punishment. Whoever took the blow should get a lesser punishment."<br><br>His manager agreed with him and said something needs to be done about it. "<a href="../players/player_7825.html">Lussier</a> is right. The league needs to look at its policy and make sure the punishment fits the crime."<br><br>Looking at his present stats, <a href="../players/player_7825.html">Lussier</a> has compiled a .132 batting average in 13 games with a .214 on-base percentage, while hitting no home runs and driving in 3 runs.<br><br><a href="../players/player_7760.html">Yeremyan</a> has taken the mound for 6 relief appearances this season, nailing down 2 saves while notching a 0-1 record with a 4.15 ERA.
