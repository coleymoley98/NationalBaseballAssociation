He suffered a sprained ankle in the 3rd inning when he tried to stretch a double into a triple and stumbled over third base.<br><br>The injury will likely heal before the start of spring training, but the incident cast a shadow over the game, which was organized to help raise money for local charities and youth leagues. It was the 2nd annual edition of the Billy Low All-Star Charity Classic, which pits a team of major leaguers against a squad of local celebrities, athletes, and media personalities.<br><br>Low's ML All-Stars did end up beating the Celebrity All-Stars squad for the second year in a row by a score of 13-5. It was the injury to Low, however, that was on the minds of most of the participants after the game. <br><br>"I feel really bad about what happened to Billy," said Nordiques teammate, <a href="../players/player_3789.html">Chairat Lookjan</a>. "I talked to him earlier though, and he reassured me that he has no regrets about participating. He's just a really competitive guy and that's just how he plays every game. Besides, he's pleased we were able to exceed our goals this year. We managed to raise nearly double the amount we raised during last year's inaugural event." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Low%20Injured%20in%20Charity%20Softball%20Game&news=Billy%20Low%20was%20injured%20today%20in%20a%20charity%20softball%20game%2E%20He%20suffered%20a%20sprained%20ankle%20in%20the%203rd%20inning%20when%20he%20tried%20to%20stretch%20a%20double%20into%20a%20triple%20and%20stumbled%20over%20third%20base%2E%0A%0AThe%20injury%20will%20likely%20heal%20before%20the%20start%20of%20spring%20training%2C%20but%20the%20incident%20cast%20a%20shadow%20over%20the%20game%2C%20which%20was%20organized%20to%20help%20raise%20money%20for%20local%20charities%20and%20youth%20leagues%2E%20It%20was%20the%202nd%20annual%20edition%20of%20the%20Billy%20Low%20All%2DStar%20Charity%20Classic%2C%20which%20pits%20a%20team%20of%20major%20leaguers%20against%20a%20squad%20of%20local%20celebrities%2C%20athletes%2C%20and%20media%20personalities%2E%0A%0ALow%27s%20ML%20All%2DStars%20did%20end%20up%20beating%20the%20Celebrity%20All%2DStars%20squad%20for%20the%20second%20year%20in%20a%20row%20by%20a%20score%20of%2013%2D5%2E%20It%20was%20the%20injury%20to%20Low%2C%20however%2C%20that%20was%20on%20the%20minds%20of%20most%20of%20the%20participants%20after%20the%20game%2E%20%0A%0A%22I%20feel%20really%20bad%20about%20what%20happened%20to%20Billy%2C%22%20said%20Nordiques%20teammate%2C%20Chairat%20Lookjan%2E%20%22I%20talked%20to%20him%20earlier%20though%2C%20and%20he%20reassured%20me%20that%20he%20has%20no%20regrets%20about%20participating%2E%20He%27s%20just%20a%20really%20competitive%20guy%20and%20that%27s%20just%20how%20he%20plays%20every%20game%2E%20Besides%2C%20he%27s%20pleased%20we%20were%20able%20to%20exceed%20our%20goals%20this%20year%2E%20We%20managed%20to%20raise%20nearly%20double%20the%20amount%20we%20raised%20during%20last%20year%27s%20inaugural%20event%2E%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
