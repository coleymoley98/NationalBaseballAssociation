This time it happened to <a href="../teams/team_131.html">Ranier</a>'s <a href="../players/player_6426.html">Amnart Mayberry</a> and <a href="../teams/team_133.html">Boise</a>'s <a href="../players/player_6766.html">Gordon Hall</a>. The two were the main participants in a fight that cleared the benches. Today both were suspended by the league for 5 games for their aggressive actions.<br><br>"I hope things settle down now," the manager of the Broncos said later. "There's no reason for us to be locked in a cycle of revenge. We all need to focus on baseball instead."<br><br>Thus far this season Mayberry is hitting .233 with no home runs, 5 RBIs and 11 runs scored. He has 20 hits in 86 at-bats and has played in 24 games.<br><br>In the 1926 season <a href="../players/player_6766.html">Hall</a> has worked 15.1 innings in 12 relief appearances and earned 2 saves. He has dished out 26 strikeouts and walked 6 with a 1-1 mark and a 5.28 ERA. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Mayberry%20and%20Hall%20Suspended%205%20Games%20for%20Brawl&news=Baseball%20confrontations%20occasionally%20get%20intense%20and%20sometimes%20that%20tension%20becomes%20too%20much%20and%20boils%20over%20into%20more%20than%20just%20words%2E%20This%20time%20it%20happened%20to%20Ranier%27s%20Amnart%20Mayberry%20and%20Boise%27s%20Gordon%20Hall%2E%20The%20two%20were%20the%20main%20participants%20in%20a%20fight%20that%20cleared%20the%20benches%2E%20Today%20both%20were%20suspended%20by%20the%20league%20for%205%20games%20for%20their%20aggressive%20actions%2E%0A%0A%22I%20hope%20things%20settle%20down%20now%2C%22%20the%20manager%20of%20the%20Broncos%20said%20later%2E%20%22There%27s%20no%20reason%20for%20us%20to%20be%20locked%20in%20a%20cycle%20of%20revenge%2E%20We%20all%20need%20to%20focus%20on%20baseball%20instead%2E%22%0A%0AThus%20far%20this%20season%20Mayberry%20is%20hitting%20%2E233%20with%20no%20home%20runs%2C%205%20RBIs%20and%2011%20runs%20scored%2E%20He%20has%2020%20hits%20in%2086%20at%2Dbats%20and%20has%20played%20in%2024%20games%2E%0A%0AIn%20the%201926%20season%20Hall%20has%20worked%2015%2E1%20innings%20in%2012%20relief%20appearances%20and%20earned%202%20saves%2E%20He%20has%20dished%20out%2026%20strikeouts%20and%20walked%206%20with%20a%201%2D1%20mark%20and%20a%205%2E28%20ERA%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
