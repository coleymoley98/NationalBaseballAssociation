"It was like all I had to do was close my eyes and swing the bat."<br><br>In a game headed for the record books, Bloom banged out 4 hits in 5 at-bats and totaled 2 RBI and 2 runs scored. Speaking with the press about the feat, he attributed it to "a lot of luck."<br><br>"A triple is so hard to hit," he said. "To just decide to get one in a game when you need it for a cycle, it's impossible. Usually something weird has to happen, the ball kicking past an outfielder or somebody falling down.
