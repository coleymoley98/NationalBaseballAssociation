Today the NBA announced its list of players filing for the event, though little is publicly known about any given player, sending scouts from each of the league's clubs scattering to uncover what they can in as little time as possible. Some clubs will draft the ideal prospect late, while others will stake their futures to big-name prospects, those deemed most likely to succeed by the fickle, nameless consensus.<br><br>A draft area has been created in the Transactions section for added functionality and will be available for 90 days prior to the draft.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_2716.html">Cliff Yasuda</a>, 18 year-old SS out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_6877.html">Marc Lovato</a>, 17 year-old RF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_6497.html">William Byrd</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_2836.html">Renato Joly</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_3694.html">Charles-Olivier King</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_6795.html">Jamad Hubbard</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_3326.html">Claude Boisvert</a>, 18 year-old SS out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_6728.html">Jake Stimson</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_6304.html">Narongsak Gosselin</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_6426.html">Amnart Mayberry</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=NBA%20News%3A%20Draft%20Pool%20Revealed&news=One%20of%20the%20few%20things%20certain%20about%20the%201926%20first%2Dyear%20player%20draft%20is%20that%20it%20will%20be%20held%2090%20days%20from%20now%2E%20Today%20the%20NBA%20announced%20its%20list%20of%20players%20filing%20for%20the%20event%2C%20though%20little%20is%20publicly%20known%20about%20any%20given%20player%2C%20sending%20scouts%20from%20each%20of%20the%20league%27s%20clubs%20scattering%20to%20uncover%20what%20they%20can%20in%20as%20little%20time%20as%20possible%2E%20Some%20clubs%20will%20draft%20the%20ideal%20prospect%20late%2C%20while%20others%20will%20stake%20their%20futures%20to%20big%2Dname%20prospects%2C%20those%20deemed%20most%20likely%20to%20succeed%20by%20the%20fickle%2C%20nameless%20consensus%2E%0A%0AA%20draft%20area%20has%20been%20created%20in%20the%20Transactions%20section%20for%20added%20functionality%20and%20will%20be%20available%20for%2090%20days%20prior%20to%20the%20draft%2E%0A%0AThe%20early%20favorites%20to%20be%20high%20picks%20are%20the%20following%3A%0A1%2E%20Cliff%20Yasuda%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20SS%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A2%2E%20Marc%20Lovato%2C%2017%20year%2Dold%20RF%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A3%2E%20William%20Byrd%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20RF%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A4%2E%20Renato%20Joly%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20RHP%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A5%2E%20Charles%2DOlivier%20King%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20LHP%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A6%2E%20Jamad%20Hubbard%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%202B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A7%2E%20Claude%20Boisvert%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20SS%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A8%2E%20Jake%20Stimson%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20RF%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A9%2E%20Narongsak%20Gosselin%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20RHP%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A10%2E%20Amnart%20Mayberry%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%202B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A%0AThe%20official%20OSA%20Mock%20Draft%20will%20be%20released%20on%20the%20day%20of%20the%20draft%2C%20or%20you%20can%20review%20the%20draft%20pool%20on%20the%20draft%20page%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
