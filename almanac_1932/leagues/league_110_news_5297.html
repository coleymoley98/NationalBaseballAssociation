He had the perfect delivery. The ball was moving. The slider was working.<br><br>In an unforgettable performance, the 18-year-old Fortier fanned 15 Rivermen and sparked the <a href="../teams/team_155.html">Adams Mounties</a> to a 2-0 victory over <a href="../teams/team_91.html">Davenport</a>. He left Rivermen hitters mumbling and muttering at the plate. And when he needed a strikeout, he got it.<br><br>"I don't know if there are many times that I've seen him throw better," said Adams manager Joseph Jones. "His location and command were really something." <br><br>In addition to collecting 15 strikeouts over 8.1 innings, Fortier allowed 2 hits and 1 walk in a superlative outing. <br><br>"I thought I'd make it easy on the guys today," Fortier said with a smile.<br><br>Up to now <a href="../players/player_2139.html">Fortier</a> has compiled an ERA of 1.84 with a 7-2 mark over 12 starts. He has 100 strikeouts in 83 innings and has held opponents to a .202 batting average. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Fortier%20Mows%20Down%2015%20Rivermen&news=Everything%20was%20working%20for%20Logan%20Fortier%20today%20at%20Ballpark%20of%20Adams%2E%20He%20had%20the%20perfect%20delivery%2E%20The%20ball%20was%20moving%2E%20The%20slider%20was%20working%2E%0A%0AIn%20an%20unforgettable%20performance%2C%20the%2018%2Dyear%2Dold%20Fortier%20fanned%2015%20Rivermen%20and%20sparked%20the%20Adams%20Mounties%20to%20a%202%2D0%20victory%20over%20Davenport%2E%20He%20left%20Rivermen%20hitters%20mumbling%20and%20muttering%20at%20the%20plate%2E%20And%20when%20he%20needed%20a%20strikeout%2C%20he%20got%20it%2E%0A%0A%22I%20don%27t%20know%20if%20there%20are%20many%20times%20that%20I%27ve%20seen%20him%20throw%20better%2C%22%20said%20Adams%20manager%20Joseph%20Jones%2E%20%22His%20location%20and%20command%20were%20really%20something%2E%22%20%0A%0AIn%20addition%20to%20collecting%2015%20strikeouts%20over%208%2E1%20innings%2C%20Fortier%20allowed%202%20hits%20and%201%20walk%20in%20a%20superlative%20outing%2E%20%0A%0A%22I%20thought%20I%27d%20make%20it%20easy%20on%20the%20guys%20today%2C%22%20Fortier%20said%20with%20a%20smile%2E%0A%0AUp%20to%20now%20Fortier%20has%20compiled%20an%20ERA%20of%201%2E84%20with%20a%207%2D2%20mark%20over%2012%20starts%2E%20He%20has%20100%20strikeouts%20in%2083%20innings%20and%20has%20held%20opponents%20to%20a%20%2E202%20batting%20average%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
