Not only does he have a stellar work ethic, he is also a fan favorite. "One day I got to the ballpark early," said superfan, Joe Stanton. "I mean I got there really early. In fact, they were still getting the field ready and the first one out of the locker room and on the field was none other than Mijangos. You can tell he just has a love for the game that goes above and beyond most players on the field. When I left that night following the game, the last player on the field was Gautam Mijangos. He makes you proud to be a fan of the Calgary Wranglers." <br><br>Teammates seem to agree. "When Gautam gets on that field, it makes all of us want to play harder for the fans," said Wranglers teammate, <a href="../players/player_8793.html">Theo Hébert</a>. "Not only is he a great guy but he is one heck of a player. He is always out there signing autographs for the kids and when he is in the gym, he is always the one hitting the weights the hardest. He is a special person on and off the field." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Wranglers%20Fans%20Love%20Hard%20Working%20Mijangos&news=Calgary%20Center%20Fielder%2C%20Gautam%20Mijangos%2C%20is%20one%20of%20the%20hardest%20workers%20in%20the%20game%2E%20Not%20only%20does%20he%20have%20a%20stellar%20work%20ethic%2C%20he%20is%20also%20a%20fan%20favorite%2E%20%22One%20day%20I%20got%20to%20the%20ballpark%20early%2C%22%20said%20superfan%2C%20Joe%20Stanton%2E%20%22I%20mean%20I%20got%20there%20really%20early%2E%20In%20fact%2C%20they%20were%20still%20getting%20the%20field%20ready%20and%20the%20first%20one%20out%20of%20the%20locker%20room%20and%20on%20the%20field%20was%20none%20other%20than%20Mijangos%2E%20You%20can%20tell%20he%20just%20has%20a%20love%20for%20the%20game%20that%20goes%20above%20and%20beyond%20most%20players%20on%20the%20field%2E%20When%20I%20left%20that%20night%20following%20the%20game%2C%20the%20last%20player%20on%20the%20field%20was%20Gautam%20Mijangos%2E%20He%20makes%20you%20proud%20to%20be%20a%20fan%20of%20the%20Calgary%20Wranglers%2E%22%20%0A%0ATeammates%20seem%20to%20agree%2E%20%22When%20Gautam%20gets%20on%20that%20field%2C%20it%20makes%20all%20of%20us%20want%20to%20play%20harder%20for%20the%20fans%2C%22%20said%20Wranglers%20teammate%2C%20Theo%20H%E9bert%2E%20%22Not%20only%20is%20he%20a%20great%20guy%20but%20he%20is%20one%20heck%20of%20a%20player%2E%20He%20is%20always%20out%20there%20signing%20autographs%20for%20the%20kids%20and%20when%20he%20is%20in%20the%20gym%2C%20he%20is%20always%20the%20one%20hitting%20the%20weights%20the%20hardest%2E%20He%20is%20a%20special%20person%20on%20and%20off%20the%20field%2E%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
