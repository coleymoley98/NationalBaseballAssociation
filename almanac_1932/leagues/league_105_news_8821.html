Well, maybe you and I would do that, but not <a href="../players/player_3550.html">Eric Woodmore</a> -- that's not his way.<br><br>After he notched number 100, the 28-year-old <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a> hurler spoke to the press like he always has -- in a soft, quiet voice. He wasn't doing any cartwheels or even anything resembling a jump for joy. "Obviously it feels very good," Woodmore commented. "To win this many games, you've got to have a lot of help."<br><br>Woodmore got his milestone victory by beating the <a href="../teams/team_102.html">Minnesota Saints</a> 6-5. He held them to 7 hits in 9 innings and rung up 4 strikeouts with no walks.<br><br>After sharing his thoughts with the press, he went to the clubhouse. There he was greeted by the guys who had helped him get #100. His teammates drenched him and then gave him a rousing round of applause.
