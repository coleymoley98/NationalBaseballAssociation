Run around Bennett Park doing cartwheels, jumping for joy and waving to the crowd? Well, maybe you and I would do that, but not <a href="../players/player_967.html">Joseph Theriot</a> -- that's not his way.<br><br>After he notched number 100, the 35-year-old <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a> hurler spoke to the press like he always has -- in a soft, quiet voice. He wasn't doing any cartwheels or even anything resembling a jump for joy. "Obviously it feels very good," Theriot commented. "To win this many games, you've got to have a lot of help."<br><br>Theriot got his milestone victory by beating the <a href="../teams/team_95.html">Juneau Brasseurs</a> 8-6. He held them to 9 hits in 8 innings and rung up 1 strikeout with 3 walks.<br><br>After sharing his thoughts with the press, he went to the clubhouse. There he was greeted by the guys who had helped him get #100. His teammates drenched him and then gave him a rousing round of applause. That got to him -- for the first time today, Theriot's face broke into a big smile.<br><br>Since his debut, <a href="../players/player_967.html">Theriot</a> has marked up 100 wins and 81 losses and fashioned an ERA of 2.85. He has fanned 858 batters while pitching 1714.2 innings. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1438.html">View Boxscore</a> </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Theriot%20Beats%20Brasseurs%20for%20100th%20Win&news=What%20would%20you%20do%20after%20you%20had%20just%20won%20your%20100th%20game%3F%20Run%20around%20Bennett%20Park%20doing%20cartwheels%2C%20jumping%20for%20joy%20and%20waving%20to%20the%20crowd%3F%20Well%2C%20maybe%20you%20and%20I%20would%20do%20that%2C%20but%20not%20Joseph%20Theriot%20%2D%2D%20that%27s%20not%20his%20way%2E%0A%0AAfter%20he%20notched%20number%20100%2C%20the%2035%2Dyear%2Dold%20Detroit%20hurler%20spoke%20to%20the%20press%20like%20he%20always%20has%20%2D%2D%20in%20a%20soft%2C%20quiet%20voice%2E%20He%20wasn%27t%20doing%20any%20cartwheels%20or%20even%20anything%20resembling%20a%20jump%20for%20joy%2E%20%22Obviously%20it%20feels%20very%20good%2C%22%20Theriot%20commented%2E%20%22To%20win%20this%20many%20games%2C%20you%27ve%20got%20to%20have%20a%20lot%20of%20help%2E%22%0A%0ATheriot%20got%20his%20milestone%20victory%20by%20beating%20the%20Juneau%20Brasseurs%208%2D6%2E%20He%20held%20them%20to%209%20hits%20in%208%20innings%20and%20rung%20up%201%20strikeout%20with%203%20walks%2E%0A%0AAfter%20sharing%20his%20thoughts%20with%20the%20press%2C%20he%20went%20to%20the%20clubhouse%2E%20There%20he%20was%20greeted%20by%20the%20guys%20who%20had%20helped%20him%20get%20%23100%2E%20His%20teammates%20drenched%20him%20and%20then%20gave%20him%20a%20rousing%20round%20of%20applause%2E%20That%20got%20to%20him%20%2D%2D%20for%20the%20first%20time%20today%2C%20Theriot%27s%20face%20broke%20into%20a%20big%20smile%2E%0A%0ASince%20his%20debut%2C%20Theriot%20has%20marked%20up%20100%20wins%20and%2081%20losses%20and%20fashioned%20an%20ERA%20of%202%2E85%2E%20He%20has%20fanned%20858%20batters%20while%20pitching%201714%2E2%20innings%2E%20%0A%0AView%20Boxscore%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
