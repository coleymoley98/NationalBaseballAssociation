One of those moments happened today at Ballpark of Drummondville.<br><br><a href="../teams/team_68.html">Drummondville</a> right-hander <a href="../players/player_3829.html">Seng Lawadin</a> threw a perfect game at as the Voltigeurs beat the <a href="../teams/team_81.html">Pawtucket Red Sox</a>, 4-0. In his post-game comments, <a href="../players/player_3829.html">Lawadin</a> told reporters that it was something he had never dreamed of.<br><br>"As a kid, you always think of pitching to win the final game of a championship," <a href="../players/player_3829.html">Lawadin</a> said. "You never think of pitching a perfect game, because it just seems unattainable. I'll remember this day for the rest of my life."<br><br>By the end of the game, Lawadin had rung up 16 <a href="../teams/team_81.html">Pawtucket</a> hitters on strikeouts, and did not allow a single baserunner. The fans gave Lawadin a standing ovation as he left the mound, knowing they had witnessed one of the rarest events in the sport. <br><br>In 6 starts this season, <a href="../players/player_3829.html">Lawadin</a> has picked up 2 wins while suffering 2 losses. He has pitched 42 innings, allowed 30 hits, struck out 44 and posted a 3.00 ERA. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Mr%2E%20Perfect%3A%20Lawadin%20Tosses%20Rare%20Gem&news=Over%20the%20course%20of%20baseball%20history%2C%20some%20moments%20stand%20a%20little%20taller%20than%20others%2E%20One%20of%20those%20moments%20happened%20today%20at%20Ballpark%20of%20Drummondville%2E%0A%0ADrummondville%20right%2Dhander%20Seng%20Lawadin%20threw%20a%20perfect%20game%20at%20as%20the%20Voltigeurs%20beat%20the%20Pawtucket%20Red%20Sox%2C%204%2D0%2E%20In%20his%20post%2Dgame%20comments%2C%20Lawadin%20told%20reporters%20that%20it%20was%20something%20he%20had%20never%20dreamed%20of%2E%0A%0A%22As%20a%20kid%2C%20you%20always%20think%20of%20pitching%20to%20win%20the%20final%20game%20of%20a%20championship%2C%22%20Lawadin%20said%2E%20%22You%20never%20think%20of%20pitching%20a%20perfect%20game%2C%20because%20it%20just%20seems%20unattainable%2E%20I%27ll%20remember%20this%20day%20for%20the%20rest%20of%20my%20life%2E%22%0A%0ABy%20the%20end%20of%20the%20game%2C%20Lawadin%20had%20rung%20up%2016%20Pawtucket%20hitters%20on%20strikeouts%2C%20and%20did%20not%20allow%20a%20single%20baserunner%2E%20The%20fans%20gave%20Lawadin%20a%20standing%20ovation%20as%20he%20left%20the%20mound%2C%20knowing%20they%20had%20witnessed%20one%20of%20the%20rarest%20events%20in%20the%20sport%2E%20%0A%0AIn%206%20starts%20this%20season%2C%20Lawadin%20has%20picked%20up%202%20wins%20while%20suffering%202%20losses%2E%20He%20has%20pitched%2042%20innings%2C%20allowed%2030%20hits%2C%20struck%20out%2044%20and%20posted%20a%203%2E00%20ERA%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
