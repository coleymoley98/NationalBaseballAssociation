For scouts, it is the toughest challenge of the season, trying to come up with an educated guess as to what a young man in his late teens or early twenties is going to do at the professional level a good five years down the road, at best. Some will go on gut instincts; some will rely on years of experience; but most will find it disconcerting how much their team is beholden to Lady Luck. Choose well and they are geniuses; choose poorly and they are unemployed.<br><br>A complete rundown of the draft list is available in the Transactions area for quick reference and will be available 90 days before the draft.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_9096.html">Yoann Christiani</a>, 17 year-old SS out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_3830.html">Steve Lowenstein</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_8956.html">Woranet Cooper</a>, 17 year-old LF out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_8750.html">Kevin Dumas</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_8995.html">Earnest Ettrick</a>, 18 year-old 1B out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_9246.html">Rattanapon Dostie</a>, 17 year-old CF out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_8761.html">Jenson Medcalf</a>, 18 year-old 3B out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_9703.html">Noppadol Houdini</a>, 17 year-old RHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_9179.html">Dylan Robitaille</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_8990.html">Vincent Beaulieu</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=NBA%20News%3A%20Draft%20Pool%20Revealed&news=National%20Baseball%20Association%20announced%20the%201931%20amateur%20draft%20pool%20today%2C%20a%20scant%2090%20days%20in%20advance%20of%20the%20actual%20draft%2E%20For%20scouts%2C%20it%20is%20the%20toughest%20challenge%20of%20the%20season%2C%20trying%20to%20come%20up%20with%20an%20educated%20guess%20as%20to%20what%20a%20young%20man%20in%20his%20late%20teens%20or%20early%20twenties%20is%20going%20to%20do%20at%20the%20professional%20level%20a%20good%20five%20years%20down%20the%20road%2C%20at%20best%2E%20Some%20will%20go%20on%20gut%20instincts%3B%20some%20will%20rely%20on%20years%20of%20experience%3B%20but%20most%20will%20find%20it%20disconcerting%20how%20much%20their%20team%20is%20beholden%20to%20Lady%20Luck%2E%20Choose%20well%20and%20they%20are%20geniuses%3B%20choose%20poorly%20and%20they%20are%20unemployed%2E%0A%0AA%20complete%20rundown%20of%20the%20draft%20list%20is%20available%20in%20the%20Transactions%20area%20for%20quick%20reference%20and%20will%20be%20available%2090%20days%20before%20the%20draft%2E%0A%0AThe%20early%20favorites%20to%20be%20high%20picks%20are%20the%20following%3A%0A1%2E%20Yoann%20Christiani%2C%2017%20year%2Dold%20SS%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A2%2E%20Steve%20Lowenstein%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%20RHP%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A3%2E%20Woranet%20Cooper%2C%2017%20year%2Dold%20LF%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A4%2E%20Kevin%20Dumas%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%202B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A5%2E%20Earnest%20Ettrick%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%201B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A6%2E%20Rattanapon%20Dostie%2C%2017%20year%2Dold%20CF%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A7%2E%20Jenson%20Medcalf%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%203B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A8%2E%20Noppadol%20Houdini%2C%2017%20year%2Dold%20RHP%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A9%2E%20Dylan%20Robitaille%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%202B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A10%2E%20Vincent%20Beaulieu%2C%2018%20year%2Dold%202B%20out%20of%20college%2E%0A%0AThe%20official%20OSA%20Mock%20Draft%20will%20be%20released%20on%20the%20day%20of%20the%20draft%2C%20or%20you%20can%20review%20the%20draft%20pool%20on%20the%20draft%20page%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
