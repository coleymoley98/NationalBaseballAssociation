"Don't let people fool you. Everybody on the field and in the ballpark knows what's happening. They just pretend they don't."<br><br>For the game, <a href="../players/player_162.html">Sulley</a> totaled 5 walks and 9 strikeouts in a very strong outing.<br><br>"His mechanics were perfect, and I don't think he threw one bad pitch in the whole game," Saskatoon manager Maurice Wigglesworth said.
