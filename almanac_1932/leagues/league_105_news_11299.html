It's tough just getting a scout to notice you, to think you are worth investing an organization's future in. Then draft day arrives and you are snatched up by someone you might not have expected. Some will catch on big; others will be away from home for the first time and will struggle to gain a solid footing in the minors. Still others will battle through, gain that coveted footing and go on to have a solid professional career.<br><br>League officials have made this information available for all clubs in a new section of the Transactions page.
