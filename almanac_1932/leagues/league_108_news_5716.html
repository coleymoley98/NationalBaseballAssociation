"To be quite frank with you, I'm firing him for cause now, I'm not firing him for anything else other than cause. I reached a point where I felt the best thing to do was to make a change. It hurts because I picked the guy. I picked the wrong guy. This is regretful, but I thought it was best for the Giants."<br><br>The owner went on to say he wanted to make it work, but it was becoming obvious that wouldn't be the case.<br><br>"Someone said to me the other day, a newspaperman, 'Why don't you tell us your side of the story? Why don't you tell us what's happening?' And I said to him, 'Look, I don't want to win in the press, I want to win on the field.'" </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=It%27s%20Official%21%20LaDue%20out%20as%20Giants%20Manager&news=Some%20choice%20words%20were%20used%20at%20the%20Vancouver%20Giants%20press%20conference%20informing%20the%20public%20that%20manager%20Elias%20LaDue%20was%20fired%20today%2E%0A%0A%22Maybe%20I%20didn%27t%20want%20to%20admit%20that%20I%20made%20a%20mistake%2C%22%20the%20team%27s%20owner%20said%2E%20%22To%20be%20quite%20frank%20with%20you%2C%20I%27m%20firing%20him%20for%20cause%20now%2C%20I%27m%20not%20firing%20him%20for%20anything%20else%20other%20than%20cause%2E%20I%20reached%20a%20point%20where%20I%20felt%20the%20best%20thing%20to%20do%20was%20to%20make%20a%20change%2E%20It%20hurts%20because%20I%20picked%20the%20guy%2E%20I%20picked%20the%20wrong%20guy%2E%20This%20is%20regretful%2C%20but%20I%20thought%20it%20was%20best%20for%20the%20Giants%2E%22%0A%0AThe%20owner%20went%20on%20to%20say%20he%20wanted%20to%20make%20it%20work%2C%20but%20it%20was%20becoming%20obvious%20that%20wouldn%27t%20be%20the%20case%2E%0A%0A%22Someone%20said%20to%20me%20the%20other%20day%2C%20a%20newspaperman%2C%20%27Why%20don%27t%20you%20tell%20us%20your%20side%20of%20the%20story%3F%20Why%20don%27t%20you%20tell%20us%20what%27s%20happening%3F%27%20And%20I%20said%20to%20him%2C%20%27Look%2C%20I%20don%27t%20want%20to%20win%20in%20the%20press%2C%20I%20want%20to%20win%20on%20the%20field%2E%27%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
