For many fans, arbitration day is simply one day closer to spring, and the beginning of a new National Baseball Association season.<br><br>For those that do follow NBA details, arbitration day is an important milestone. Held for any players who were unable to come to terms on a new contract agreement with their team, these hearings can determine whether a player ends up making 70 percent or 100 percent of their contract demands. <br><br>Observers often worry that arbitration hearings will affect the relationship between players and their team, although the players are quick to disagree. <br><br>"Look, this is a business thing," said one arbitration-eligible player who asked to speak anonymously. "I am doing what I can to make as much money as I can and the owner is doing the same. I don't take it personally."<br><br>One wonders if that player will feel the same if he loses his arbitration decision. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Order%20in%20the%20Court%20%2D%20Arbitration%20Hearings%20Arrive&news=Few%20fans%20have%20the%20patience%20to%20keep%20up%20with%20the%20ins%20and%20outs%20of%20the%20NBA%27s%20collective%20bargaining%20agreement%2E%20For%20many%20fans%2C%20arbitration%20day%20is%20simply%20one%20day%20closer%20to%20spring%2C%20and%20the%20beginning%20of%20a%20new%20National%20Baseball%20Association%20season%2E%0A%0AFor%20those%20that%20do%20follow%20NBA%20details%2C%20arbitration%20day%20is%20an%20important%20milestone%2E%20Held%20for%20any%20players%20who%20were%20unable%20to%20come%20to%20terms%20on%20a%20new%20contract%20agreement%20with%20their%20team%2C%20these%20hearings%20can%20determine%20whether%20a%20player%20ends%20up%20making%2070%20percent%20or%20100%20percent%20of%20their%20contract%20demands%2E%20%0A%0AObservers%20often%20worry%20that%20arbitration%20hearings%20will%20affect%20the%20relationship%20between%20players%20and%20their%20team%2C%20although%20the%20players%20are%20quick%20to%20disagree%2E%20%0A%0A%22Look%2C%20this%20is%20a%20business%20thing%2C%22%20said%20one%20arbitration%2Deligible%20player%20who%20asked%20to%20speak%20anonymously%2E%20%22I%20am%20doing%20what%20I%20can%20to%20make%20as%20much%20money%20as%20I%20can%20and%20the%20owner%20is%20doing%20the%20same%2E%20I%20don%27t%20take%20it%20personally%2E%22%0A%0AOne%20wonders%20if%20that%20player%20will%20feel%20the%20same%20if%20he%20loses%20his%20arbitration%20decision%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
