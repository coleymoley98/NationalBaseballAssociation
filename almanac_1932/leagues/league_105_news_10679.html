According to teammates, <a href="../players/player_6221.html">Ned Barr</a> decided to try and give Boutin a fright by donning a mask and sneaking up on him in the shower. The prank worked. Unfortunately for the Liberty, it worked a little too well. Boutin apparently was so startled by the intrusion that he instinctively flung his arm around to defend himself and unintentionally hit his hand against the shower knob. Boutin sustained a laceration to his hand, which required several stitches, as well as a bruised thumb. "Akarin was surprisingly good-natured about the incident," said manager Kendrick Markowski. "Nonetheless, he'll be out for the next few games and that's gonna hurts us." Markowski declined to say whether Barr would be disciplined for the prank, but says he does believe he is sincerely remorseful for what happened. "I know Ned feels worse about it than anyone, but I'll have to decide whether or not tha<br>t's sufficient punishment. Either way, we'll handle the matter privately." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Clubhouse%20Prank%20May%20Sideline%20Boutin&news=Philadelphia%20left%20fielder%20Akarin%20Boutin%20may%20miss%20a%20week%27s%20worth%20of%20games%20due%20to%20a%20clubhouse%20prank%20gone%20wrong%2E%20According%20to%20teammates%2C%20Ned%20Barr%20decided%20to%20try%20and%20give%20Boutin%20a%20fright%20by%20donning%20a%20mask%20and%20sneaking%20up%20on%20him%20in%20the%20shower%2E%20The%20prank%20worked%2E%20Unfortunately%20for%20the%20Liberty%2C%20it%20worked%20a%20little%20too%20well%2E%20Boutin%20apparently%20was%20so%20startled%20by%20the%20intrusion%20that%20he%20instinctively%20flung%20his%20arm%20around%20to%20defend%20himself%20and%20unintentionally%20hit%20his%20hand%20against%20the%20shower%20knob%2E%20Boutin%20sustained%20a%20laceration%20to%20his%20hand%2C%20which%20required%20several%20stitches%2C%20as%20well%20as%20a%20bruised%20thumb%2E%20%22Akarin%20was%20surprisingly%20good%2Dnatured%20about%20the%20incident%2C%22%20said%20manager%20Kendrick%20Markowski%2E%20%22Nonetheless%2C%20he%27ll%20be%20out%20for%20the%20next%20few%20games%20and%20that%27s%20gonna%20hurts%20us%2E%22%20Markowski%20declined%20to%20say%20whether%20Barr%20would%20be%20disciplined%20for%20the%20prank%2C%20but%20says%20he%20does%20believe%20he%20is%20sincerely%20remorseful%20for%20what%20happened%2E%20%22I%20know%20Ned%20feels%20worse%20about%20it%20than%20anyone%2C%20but%20I%27ll%20have%20to%20decide%20whether%20or%20not%20tha%0At%27s%20sufficient%20punishment%2E%20Either%20way%2C%20we%27ll%20handle%20the%20matter%20privately%2E%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
