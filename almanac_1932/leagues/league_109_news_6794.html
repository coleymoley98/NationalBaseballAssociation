Noted for his feisty, no-nonsense attitude, <a href="../coaches/coach_186.html">McLain</a> threw his all into the 1925 campaign, winning over critics and fans as he went. He also won a few ballgames, running up a 59-23 record, which was good enough to take the first place spot in the   standings. <br><br>"These guys are grown men. They don't need psychobabble, they need to win ballgames," <a href="../coaches/coach_186.html">McLain</a> snapped at his first press conference. While his approach was controversial, even for <a href="../teams/team_154.html">Pittsburgh</a>, it netted the 48-year-old the Eastern League Manager of the Year trophy. In response to which he replied, "It ain't molecular physics, it's baseball," and began discussing potential free agents with the local media. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=McLain%20Wins%20EL%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Trophy&news=Pittsburgh%20manager%20Virgil%20McLain%20caused%20quite%20a%20stir%20when%20he%20came%20to%20town%2E%20Noted%20for%20his%20feisty%2C%20no%2Dnonsense%20attitude%2C%20McLain%20threw%20his%20all%20into%20the%201925%20campaign%2C%20winning%20over%20critics%20and%20fans%20as%20he%20went%2E%20He%20also%20won%20a%20few%20ballgames%2C%20running%20up%20a%2059%2D23%20record%2C%20which%20was%20good%20enough%20to%20take%20the%20first%20place%20spot%20in%20the%20%20%20standings%2E%20%0A%0A%22These%20guys%20are%20grown%20men%2E%20They%20don%27t%20need%20psychobabble%2C%20they%20need%20to%20win%20ballgames%2C%22%20McLain%20snapped%20at%20his%20first%20press%20conference%2E%20While%20his%20approach%20was%20controversial%2C%20even%20for%20Pittsburgh%2C%20it%20netted%20the%2048%2Dyear%2Dold%20the%20Eastern%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20trophy%2E%20In%20response%20to%20which%20he%20replied%2C%20%22It%20ain%27t%20molecular%20physics%2C%20it%27s%20baseball%2C%22%20and%20began%20discussing%20potential%20free%20agents%20with%20the%20local%20media%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
