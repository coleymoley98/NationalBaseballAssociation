It is now the offseason in baseball. While the annual awards will be announced shortly, for many fans and some players, this is the worst of times. An old-time player was once asked what he did in the offseason. He replied, "Mostly, I just stand at the window and stare and wait for the new season." Many fans feel that way, too.<br><br>The feeling is certainly different in WL front offices, though. For those men and women, the offseason is a hectic time of roster evaluations, analysis and change. Who will re-sign? What players will we go after? Where should we send our scouts? Who will be hanging up his spikes? Each club's success for next year and beyond will be largely determined by the wheelin' and dealin' that transpires over the next several months.<br><br>You may now vote for the league award winners, the option is available in the league menu. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=WL%20News%3A%20The%20Offseason%20Begins&news=It%20was%20the%20best%20of%20times%20in%20the%20just%2Dfinished%20WL%20season%2E%20It%20is%20now%20the%20offseason%20in%20baseball%2E%20While%20the%20annual%20awards%20will%20be%20announced%20shortly%2C%20for%20many%20fans%20and%20some%20players%2C%20this%20is%20the%20worst%20of%20times%2E%20An%20old%2Dtime%20player%20was%20once%20asked%20what%20he%20did%20in%20the%20offseason%2E%20He%20replied%2C%20%22Mostly%2C%20I%20just%20stand%20at%20the%20window%20and%20stare%20and%20wait%20for%20the%20new%20season%2E%22%20Many%20fans%20feel%20that%20way%2C%20too%2E%0A%0AThe%20feeling%20is%20certainly%20different%20in%20WL%20front%20offices%2C%20though%2E%20For%20those%20men%20and%20women%2C%20the%20offseason%20is%20a%20hectic%20time%20of%20roster%20evaluations%2C%20analysis%20and%20change%2E%20Who%20will%20re%2Dsign%3F%20What%20players%20will%20we%20go%20after%3F%20Where%20should%20we%20send%20our%20scouts%3F%20Who%20will%20be%20hanging%20up%20his%20spikes%3F%20Each%20club%27s%20success%20for%20next%20year%20and%20beyond%20will%20be%20largely%20determined%20by%20the%20wheelin%27%20and%20dealin%27%20that%20transpires%20over%20the%20next%20several%20months%2E%0A%0AYou%20may%20now%20vote%20for%20the%20league%20award%20winners%2C%20the%20option%20is%20available%20in%20the%20league%20menu%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
