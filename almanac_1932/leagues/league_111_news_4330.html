We are always concerned about our fan base, but this was not the primary reason for the dismissal. In the last few months, things have gone downhill and we just had to do something about it. We decided to get new leadership in the clubhouse." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Manager%20Bax%20Leaves%2C%20Dismissed%20by%20Fort%20Wayne&news=The%20fans%20in%20Fort%20Wayne%20have%20gotten%20their%20way%20%2D%2D%20today%20the%20Pioneers%20parted%20company%20with%20manager%20Ethan%20Bax%2E%0A%0AHe%20had%20been%20living%20on%20borrowed%20time%20after%20a%20poll%20of%20local%20sports%20fans%20found%20that%20he%20was%20losing%20popularity%20quickly%2E%20Fans%20had%20been%20increasingly%20more%20vocal%20about%20their%20displeasure%20with%20how%20Bax%20was%20running%20the%20club%20on%20and%20off%20the%20field%2E%0A%0AThey%20had%20even%20created%20a%20%22Fire%20Bax%20Zone%22%20in%20the%20right%20field%20bleachers%2C%20where%20fans%20would%20post%20signs%20and%20dress%20in%20t%2Dshirts%20supporting%20his%20exodus%20as%20manager%2E%0A%0AAsked%20if%20fan%20pressure%20had%20any%20effect%20on%20the%20termination%2C%20a%20Pioneers%20official%2C%20spoke%20off%20the%20record%20and%20said%2C%20%22Yes%2C%20it%20had%20a%20bearing%2E%20We%20are%20always%20concerned%20about%20our%20fan%20base%2C%20but%20this%20was%20not%20the%20primary%20reason%20for%20the%20dismissal%2E%20In%20the%20last%20few%20months%2C%20things%20have%20gone%20downhill%20and%20we%20just%20had%20to%20do%20something%20about%20it%2E%20We%20decided%20to%20get%20new%20leadership%20in%20the%20clubhouse%2E%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
