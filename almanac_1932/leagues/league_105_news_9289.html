Prior to an important game, he once told reporters, "If we lose today, it will be over my dead body. They'll have to leave me face down on the mound."<br><br>It was this attitude that helped to inspire Tuptimtong to such an outstanding career. Today he was rewarded with his admission into the National Baseball Association Hall of Fame.<br><br><a href="../players/player_2108.html">Tuptimtong</a> retired from baseball at age 35 and fashioned a 147-99 won-lost record in his career with a 2.10 ERA. The gifted hurler appeared in 313 games, fanned 1106 hitters and piled up 2360 innings pitched.<br><br>One of his managers at the induction ceremony observed, "<a href="../players/player_2108.html">Ittipol</a> was a bulldog on the mound. If a man put a gun to my head and said I'm going to pull the trigger, if you lose this game, I'd want him to pitch that game." </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Tuptimtong%20Honored%20by%20First%20Ballot%20Selection%20to%20NBA%20Hall%20of%20Fame&news=During%20his%20fantastic%20pitching%20career%20Ittipol%20Tuptimtong%20was%20hard%2Dnosed%20competitor%2E%20Prior%20to%20an%20important%20game%2C%20he%20once%20told%20reporters%2C%20%22If%20we%20lose%20today%2C%20it%20will%20be%20over%20my%20dead%20body%2E%20They%27ll%20have%20to%20leave%20me%20face%20down%20on%20the%20mound%2E%22%0A%0AIt%20was%20this%20attitude%20that%20helped%20to%20inspire%20Tuptimtong%20to%20such%20an%20outstanding%20career%2E%20Today%20he%20was%20rewarded%20with%20his%20admission%20into%20the%20National%20Baseball%20Association%20Hall%20of%20Fame%2E%0A%0ATuptimtong%20retired%20from%20baseball%20at%20age%2035%20and%20fashioned%20a%20147%2D99%20won%2Dlost%20record%20in%20his%20career%20with%20a%202%2E10%20ERA%2E%20The%20gifted%20hurler%20appeared%20in%20313%20games%2C%20fanned%201106%20hitters%20and%20piled%20up%202360%20innings%20pitched%2E%0A%0AOne%20of%20his%20managers%20at%20the%20induction%20ceremony%20observed%2C%20%22Ittipol%20was%20a%20bulldog%20on%20the%20mound%2E%20If%20a%20man%20put%20a%20gun%20to%20my%20head%20and%20said%20I%27m%20going%20to%20pull%20the%20trigger%2C%20if%20you%20lose%20this%20game%2C%20I%27d%20want%20him%20to%20pitch%20that%20game%2E%22%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
