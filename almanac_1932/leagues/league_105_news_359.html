"Whatever happened to journalistic integrity?" the Braves skipper asked during a live radio interview. "No one cares about reporting the facts anymore. It's all about sensationalism these days. All you guys care about is selling newspapers and driving up ratings. And I'm getting pretty damn sick of it." Owens seemed to be referring to recent stories that have suggested the Braves struggles as of late have been the result of off-field distractions. <br><br>One article, which accuses <a href="../players/player_6489.html">Matthew Dobbins</a> of numerous "extracurricular indiscretions", has been a particularly sore subject for Owens. "What players do on their own time is their business, but to imply that any of my players aren't giving it their all on the field is absolutely ridiculous," Owens said, "and to make these kinds of accusations against someone without any proof is just plain irresponsible!" <br><br>Team officials had no comment when asked about Owens's remarks. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Toronto%20Skipper%20Owens%20Blasts%20Media%20Over%20Bad%20Press&news=Braves%20manager%2C%20Peerapong%20Owens%2C%20had%20some%20choice%20words%20for%20the%20Toronto%20media%20today%2E%20%22Whatever%20happened%20to%20journalistic%20integrity%3F%22%20the%20Braves%20skipper%20asked%20during%20a%20live%20radio%20interview%2E%20%22No%20one%20cares%20about%20reporting%20the%20facts%20anymore%2E%20It%27s%20all%20about%20sensationalism%20these%20days%2E%20All%20you%20guys%20care%20about%20is%20selling%20newspapers%20and%20driving%20up%20ratings%2E%20And%20I%27m%20getting%20pretty%20damn%20sick%20of%20it%2E%22%20Owens%20seemed%20to%20be%20referring%20to%20recent%20stories%20that%20have%20suggested%20the%20Braves%20struggles%20as%20of%20late%20have%20been%20the%20result%20of%20off%2Dfield%20distractions%2E%20%0A%0AOne%20article%2C%20which%20accuses%20Matthew%20Dobbins%20of%20numerous%20%22extracurricular%20indiscretions%22%2C%20has%20been%20a%20particularly%20sore%20subject%20for%20Owens%2E%20%22What%20players%20do%20on%20their%20own%20time%20is%20their%20business%2C%20but%20to%20imply%20that%20any%20of%20my%20players%20aren%27t%20giving%20it%20their%20all%20on%20the%20field%20is%20absolutely%20ridiculous%2C%22%20Owens%20said%2C%20%22and%20to%20make%20these%20kinds%20of%20accusations%20against%20someone%20without%20any%20proof%20is%20just%20plain%20irresponsible%21%22%20%0A%0ATeam%20officials%20had%20no%20comment%20when%20asked%20about%20Owens%27s%20remarks%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
