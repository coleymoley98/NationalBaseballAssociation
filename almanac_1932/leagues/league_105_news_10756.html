Well, <a href="../players/player_3427.html">Hakim Semple</a> did something even better -- the 31-year-old <a href="../teams/team_102.html">Minnesota Saints</a> star has now won 100 games in his career. That put him in a very select group of pitchers.<br><br>He joined that exclusive club today at Ballpark of Quebec by whipping the <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a> 5-1, holding them to 9 hits in 9 innings while chalking up 6 strikeouts and 2 walks.<br><br>In the postgame interview, the modest Semple said, "It's special to win 100 games. You don't do it by yourself. You do it with good stuff and a good bullpen. You are only as good as the guys behind you. Years from now I might look back on it and give myself a little pat on the back."<br><br>Reviewing his career stats, <a href="../players/player_3427.html">Semple</a> has worked 1623 innings with 778 strikeouts en route to a 100-71 record.
