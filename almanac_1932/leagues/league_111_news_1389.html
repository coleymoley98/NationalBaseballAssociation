For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.<br><br>But the disgruntled Jardan lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.<br><br>But it got worse after the game, when Jardan told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him.
