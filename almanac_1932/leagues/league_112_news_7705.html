The trophy was presented to Drolet moments after his club eliminated the <a href="../teams/team_162.html">St. John's Mariners</a> to advance to the Laurier Cup.<br><br>Coude won the final game by a score of 13-1 at T-Mobile Park and took the series 4-2.<br><br>"We won the series and that's the main thing," Drolet said. "They were a tough team and we didn't want to take anything for granted."<br><br>For the series, Drolet hit .450 with a .593 on-base percentage. He had 2 home runs, drove in 5 RBI and scored 6 runs.<br><br>"He was tough to stop and that's a big reason they're there and we're here," said a dejected St. John's manager <a href="../coaches/coach_508.html">Joey Bumpers</a>.<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_89.html">Coude Voyageurs</a> don't know who they will face in the next round. They will play the winner of the <a href="../teams/team_83.html">Hartford Whalers</a> - <a href="../teams/team_85.html">Quebec City Jr. Nordiques</a> series. That series is tied at 3 games apiece. The Laurier Cup schedule will be announced after the Division Finals finishes. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Coude%20Takes%20Division%20Finals&news=Coude%20center%20fielder%20Thomas%20Drolet%20couldn%27t%20hide%20his%20reaction%20when%20asked%20about%20being%20named%20MVP%20of%20the%20Division%20Finals%2E%0A%0A%22It%27s%20a%20nice%20honor%2C%22%20he%20said%2C%20failing%20to%20suppress%20a%20wide%20smile%2E%20The%20trophy%20was%20presented%20to%20Drolet%20moments%20after%20his%20club%20eliminated%20the%20St%2E%20John%27s%20Mariners%20to%20advance%20to%20the%20Laurier%20Cup%2E%0A%0ACoude%20won%20the%20final%20game%20by%20a%20score%20of%2013%2D1%20at%20T%2DMobile%20Park%20and%20took%20the%20series%204%2D2%2E%0A%0A%22We%20won%20the%20series%20and%20that%27s%20the%20main%20thing%2C%22%20Drolet%20said%2E%20%22They%20were%20a%20tough%20team%20and%20we%20didn%27t%20want%20to%20take%20anything%20for%20granted%2E%22%0A%0AFor%20the%20series%2C%20Drolet%20hit%20%2E450%20with%20a%20%2E593%20on%2Dbase%20percentage%2E%20He%20had%202%20home%20runs%2C%20drove%20in%205%20RBI%20and%20scored%206%20runs%2E%0A%0A%22He%20was%20tough%20to%20stop%20and%20that%27s%20a%20big%20reason%20they%27re%20there%20and%20we%27re%20here%2C%22%20said%20a%20dejected%20St%2E%20John%27s%20manager%20Joey%20Bumpers%2E%0A%0AThe%20Coude%20Voyageurs%20don%27t%20know%20who%20they%20will%20face%20in%20the%20next%20round%2E%20They%20will%20play%20the%20winner%20of%20the%20Hartford%20Whalers%20%2D%20Quebec%20City%20Jr%2E%20Nordiques%20series%2E%20That%20series%20is%20tied%20at%203%20games%20apiece%2E%20The%20Laurier%20Cup%20schedule%20will%20be%20announced%20after%20the%20Division%20Finals%20finishes%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
