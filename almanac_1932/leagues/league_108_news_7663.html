His day of glory wasn't able to win the game, however. The <a href="../teams/team_145.html">Vancouver Giants</a> got the 8-6 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_144.html">Winnipeg Thunder</a>.<br><br>"I never realized that a few hits could cause so much commotion," the second baseman said in the clubhouse after the game, crowded by reporters. "Headlines and highlights are great, but it takes a lot of luster off it that we lost."<br><br>After his first couple of hits, all eyes in the ballpark were on him each time <a href="../players/player_6176.html">Keys</a> stepped into the batter's box. Even some opposing fans were pulling for him, knowing they were watching a little slice of baseball history unfold. <br><br>When asked what the secret of hitting so well is, he smiled and said "relax, concentrate, and hit the ball where they ain't." <br><br>That's exactly what he did today, as Keys finished the game with 5 hits in 6 at-bats and a line in the record book. <a href="../players/player_6176.html">Barrett Keys</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, grounded out in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 6th, singled in the 8th and hit an RBI single in the 9th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_6176.html">Keys</a> is batting .331 with 0 home runs and 27 RBIs this season. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Thunder%20Keys%20Smacks%205%20Hits&news=Barrett%20Keys%20was%20on%20quite%20a%20roll%20today%20as%20he%20knocked%20the%20ball%20all%20over%20Oracle%20Park%2C%20collecting%205%20hits%2E%20His%20day%20of%20glory%20wasn%27t%20able%20to%20win%20the%20game%2C%20however%2E%20The%20Vancouver%20Giants%20got%20the%208%2D6%20victory%20over%20the%20Winnipeg%20Thunder%2E%0A%0A%22I%20never%20realized%20that%20a%20few%20hits%20could%20cause%20so%20much%20commotion%2C%22%20the%20second%20baseman%20said%20in%20the%20clubhouse%20after%20the%20game%2C%20crowded%20by%20reporters%2E%20%22Headlines%20and%20highlights%20are%20great%2C%20but%20it%20takes%20a%20lot%20of%20luster%20off%20it%20that%20we%20lost%2E%22%0A%0AAfter%20his%20first%20couple%20of%20hits%2C%20all%20eyes%20in%20the%20ballpark%20were%20on%20him%20each%20time%20Keys%20stepped%20into%20the%20batter%27s%20box%2E%20Even%20some%20opposing%20fans%20were%20pulling%20for%20him%2C%20knowing%20they%20were%20watching%20a%20little%20slice%20of%20baseball%20history%20unfold%2E%20%0A%0AWhen%20asked%20what%20the%20secret%20of%20hitting%20so%20well%20is%2C%20he%20smiled%20and%20said%20%22relax%2C%20concentrate%2C%20and%20hit%20the%20ball%20where%20they%20ain%27t%2E%22%20%0A%0AThat%27s%20exactly%20what%20he%20did%20today%2C%20as%20Keys%20finished%20the%20game%20with%205%20hits%20in%206%20at%2Dbats%20and%20a%20line%20in%20the%20record%20book%2E%20Barrett%20Keys%20singled%20in%20the%201st%2C%20singled%20in%20the%203rd%2C%20grounded%20out%20in%20the%204th%2C%20hit%20an%20RBI%20single%20in%20the%206th%2C%20singled%20in%20the%208th%20and%20hit%20an%20RBI%20single%20in%20the%209th%2E%0A%0AKeys%20is%20batting%20%2E331%20with%200%20home%20runs%20and%2027%20RBIs%20this%20season%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
