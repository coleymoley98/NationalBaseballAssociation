That was the news from the Blue Sox clubhouse today as it was learned that left fielder <a href="../players/player_3801.html">Cooper Belli</a> will be out for an added 5 days as a result of a recent injury. His treatment for an oblique strain will have to be extended. Initially it didn't seem the injury was a major concern, but the <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto</a> left fielder told team trainers of some discomfort yesterday morning, and upon examination it was determined to be a more serious injury. "We'd rather take this thing slowly and make sure <a href="../players/player_3801.html">Cooper</a> gets back onto the field healthy," said the team's head trainer. <br><br>Looking at his stats this year, <a href="../players/player_3801.html">Belli</a> has compiled a .291 batting average, while hitting no home runs and driving in 4 runs. He has played in 15 games and scored 6 runs. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Toronto%27s%20Cooper%20Belli%20Suffers%20Setback&news=%22It%27s%20worse%20than%20we%20thought%2E%22%20That%20was%20the%20news%20from%20the%20Blue%20Sox%20clubhouse%20today%20as%20it%20was%20learned%20that%20left%20fielder%20Cooper%20Belli%20will%20be%20out%20for%20an%20added%205%20days%20as%20a%20result%20of%20a%20recent%20injury%2E%20His%20treatment%20for%20an%20oblique%20strain%20will%20have%20to%20be%20extended%2E%20Initially%20it%20didn%27t%20seem%20the%20injury%20was%20a%20major%20concern%2C%20but%20the%20Toronto%20left%20fielder%20told%20team%20trainers%20of%20some%20discomfort%20yesterday%20morning%2C%20and%20upon%20examination%20it%20was%20determined%20to%20be%20a%20more%20serious%20injury%2E%20%22We%27d%20rather%20take%20this%20thing%20slowly%20and%20make%20sure%20Cooper%20gets%20back%20onto%20the%20field%20healthy%2C%22%20said%20the%20team%27s%20head%20trainer%2E%20%0A%0ALooking%20at%20his%20stats%20this%20year%2C%20Belli%20has%20compiled%20a%20%2E291%20batting%20average%2C%20while%20hitting%20no%20home%20runs%20and%20driving%20in%204%20runs%2E%20He%20has%20played%20in%2015%20games%20and%20scored%206%20runs%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
