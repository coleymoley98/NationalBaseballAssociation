That was made official today when the <a href="../teams/team_101.html">Baltimore Robins</a> were mathematically eliminated from contention. <br><br>With the entire front office staff's jobs possibly at risk yet again the team piled up another fruitless year adding to the less than enviable total.<br><br>Manager <a href="../coaches/coach_28.html">Eldin Gabriel</a>, said after the last game went final, "Well, we fell short again. No one remembers the manager of a loser. No one remembers the boys who fell flat. By next year it's possible I'm just a name in the record books. But I'll be damned if we didn't give it our all this season."<br><br>While some fans were quick to blame ownership for not creating the proper environment for winning, the players seemed to pin it on the lack of executing when it mattered most. A few said that they had enough of a team this past year to make a championship a realistic outcome. Most national writers however disagreed and bet the farm against it early on. <br><br>The offseason will prove vital once more in their tireless effort to return to relevancy. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Baltimore%20Robins%20Go%20Another%20Year%20Without%20a%20Playoff%20Berth&news=It%20reached%20an%20unbearable%20103%20degrees%20in%20Texas%20this%20past%20week%20as%20they%20continued%20through%20a%20seven%2Dweek%20period%20with%20little%20or%20no%20rainfall%2E%0A%0ABut%20if%20you%20were%20to%20ask%20a%20Baltimore%20Robins%20fan%20about%20the%20worst%20drought%20right%20now%20he%27d%20be%20quick%20to%20remind%20you%20that%20his%20boys%20haven%27t%20raised%20a%20championship%20banner%20in%20a%20long%20time%2E%20That%20was%20made%20official%20today%20when%20the%20Baltimore%20Robins%20were%20mathematically%20eliminated%20from%20contention%2E%20%0A%0AWith%20the%20entire%20front%20office%20staff%27s%20jobs%20possibly%20at%20risk%20yet%20again%20the%20team%20piled%20up%20another%20fruitless%20year%20adding%20to%20the%20less%20than%20enviable%20total%2E%0A%0AManager%20Eldin%20Gabriel%2C%20said%20after%20the%20last%20game%20went%20final%2C%20%22Well%2C%20we%20fell%20short%20again%2E%20No%20one%20remembers%20the%20manager%20of%20a%20loser%2E%20No%20one%20remembers%20the%20boys%20who%20fell%20flat%2E%20By%20next%20year%20it%27s%20possible%20I%27m%20just%20a%20name%20in%20the%20record%20books%2E%20But%20I%27ll%20be%20damned%20if%20we%20didn%27t%20give%20it%20our%20all%20this%20season%2E%22%0A%0AWhile%20some%20fans%20were%20quick%20to%20blame%20ownership%20for%20not%20creating%20the%20proper%20environment%20for%20winning%2C%20the%20players%20seemed%20to%20pin%20it%20on%20the%20lack%20of%20executing%20when%20it%20mattered%20most%2E%20A%20few%20said%20that%20they%20had%20enough%20of%20a%20team%20this%20past%20year%20to%20make%20a%20championship%20a%20realistic%20outcome%2E%20Most%20national%20writers%20however%20disagreed%20and%20bet%20the%20farm%20against%20it%20early%20on%2E%20%0A%0AThe%20offseason%20will%20prove%20vital%20once%20more%20in%20their%20tireless%20effort%20to%20return%20to%20relevancy%2E%0A"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
