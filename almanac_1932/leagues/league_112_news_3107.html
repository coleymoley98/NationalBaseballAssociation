It's done by the great and the not-so-great alike, and for nearly all of them it represents the pinnacle of a career. <a href="../teams/team_87.html">Sherbrooke Canadiens</a> pitcher <a href="../players/player_3943.html">David Banks</a> had his moment today at Ballpark of Drummondville, holding the <a href="../teams/team_68.html">Drummondville Voltigeurs</a> hitless and beating them, 4-0.<br><br>"Everything was working for him," Voltigeurs manager <a href="../coaches/coach_323.html">Tai Grigsby</a> said. "He had a lot of late movement that seemed to cause the guys trouble, especially from the fifth inning on.  He was in command."<br><br>Banks rung up 8 strikeouts, issued 3 walks and faced only 30 hitters in his historic outing. After the game, he spoke to BNN reporters in the Sherbrooke locker room.<br><br>"I really got nervous in the last inning," Banks recalled. "I knew I had a chance at a no-hitter but it was hard to stay calm and concentrate. Thank goodness for my catcher. He told me he would do all the thinking and I could just concentrate on hitting his glove."<br><br><a href="../players/player_3943.html">Banks</a> has made 10 starts so far this year and put up a 4-1 won-lost record with a 1.92 ERA. In 61 innings he has allowed 38 hits, walked 25 and struck out 53. </td><td valign="bottom" align="right"><a href="http://facebook.ootpdevelopments.com/postootp21news.php?subject=Yes%2C%20It%27s%20a%20No%2DNo%20by%20Banks&news=The%20no%2Dhitter%20is%20one%20of%20baseball%27s%20truly%20egalitarian%20achievements%2E%20It%27s%20done%20by%20the%20great%20and%20the%20not%2Dso%2Dgreat%20alike%2C%20and%20for%20nearly%20all%20of%20them%20it%20represents%20the%20pinnacle%20of%20a%20career%2E%20Sherbrooke%20Canadiens%20pitcher%20David%20Banks%20had%20his%20moment%20today%20at%20Ballpark%20of%20Drummondville%2C%20holding%20the%20Drummondville%20Voltigeurs%20hitless%20and%20beating%20them%2C%204%2D0%2E%0A%0A%22Everything%20was%20working%20for%20him%2C%22%20Voltigeurs%20manager%20Tai%20Grigsby%20said%2E%20%22He%20had%20a%20lot%20of%20late%20movement%20that%20seemed%20to%20cause%20the%20guys%20trouble%2C%20especially%20from%20the%20fifth%20inning%20on%2E%20%20He%20was%20in%20command%2E%22%0A%0ABanks%20rung%20up%208%20strikeouts%2C%20issued%203%20walks%20and%20faced%20only%2030%20hitters%20in%20his%20historic%20outing%2E%20After%20the%20game%2C%20he%20spoke%20to%20BNN%20reporters%20in%20the%20Sherbrooke%20locker%20room%2E%0A%0A%22I%20really%20got%20nervous%20in%20the%20last%20inning%2C%22%20Banks%20recalled%2E%20%22I%20knew%20I%20had%20a%20chance%20at%20a%20no%2Dhitter%20but%20it%20was%20hard%20to%20stay%20calm%20and%20concentrate%2E%20Thank%20goodness%20for%20my%20catcher%2E%20He%20told%20me%20he%20would%20do%20all%20the%20thinking%20and%20I%20could%20just%20concentrate%20on%20hitting%20his%20glove%2E%22%0A%0ABanks%20has%20made%2010%20starts%20so%20far%20this%20year%20and%20put%20up%20a%204%2D1%20won%2Dlost%20record%20with%20a%201%2E92%20ERA%2E%20In%2061%20innings%20he%20has%20allowed%2038%20hits%2C%20walked%2025%20and%20struck%20out%2053%2E"><img src="../images/facebook_32.png" border="0"></a><a href=""><img src="../images/twitter_32.png" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr> <td style="padding-top:8px;"><!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE FOOTER --><img src="../images/bnn_bottom_bar.jpg" border="0"><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE FOOTER --></td>  </tr></table> <!-- OOTP IGNORE START PAGE BOTTOM --><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="968px">  <tr><td style="padding-top:2px; font-size:11px; text-align:center;"> Monday, August 17th, 2020 - OOTP Baseball 21.5 Build 76 </td></tr></table><!-- OOTP IGNORE END PAGE BOTTOM -->  </body></html>
