						Rebels starting pitcher <a href="../players/player_45.html">Jordan Christian</a> is in critical but stable condition today after falling from the roof of his house yesterday. According to team officials, Christian had been working on his roof with a friend when he apparently slipped and fell over the side of the two-story home. A hospital spokesman indicated that Christian landed on his back and had also sustained head trauma. His prognosis was unclear as of this morning, but he is reportedly awake and talking. "We're all praying hard for him", said manager Antoine Morissette. "Tragedies like this have a way of pulling people together and I know several of his teammates are there at the hospital with him." One of those teammates, starting pitcher <a href="../players/player_257.html">Moussa Becker</a>, spoke to reporters earlier today. " Jordan is a tough guy. I'm confident he's gonna get through this and I know the entire Rebels organization and the people of New York are pulling for him right now."
