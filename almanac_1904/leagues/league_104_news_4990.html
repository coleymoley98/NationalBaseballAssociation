						The "hardest feat in sports" debate is a never-ending one with no correct answer, but hitting three home runs is certainly in the conversation. That's exactly what <a href="../players/player_1715.html">Salvatore Boivin</a> did today at Juniors Ballpark, going deep three times and carrying his team to victory, 14-6.<br><br>"It all came together. I was seeing the ball well and I got some good pitches to hit," Boivin said. "Good things happen, when that happens."<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_82.html">Canton Juniors</a> left fielder blistered the <a href="../teams/team_72.html">Toronto Juniors</a> for 5 hits, batted in 9 runs and scored 3 times.<br><br>"It ain't like we weren't trying," <a href="../teams/team_72.html">Toronto</a> manager <a href="../coaches/coach_118.html">Rory Flowers</a> said. "He was hot and really torched my boys today."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1715.html">Salvatore Boivin</a> singled in the 2nd, hit an RBI double in the 4th, hit a three-run home run off <a href="../players/player_1686.html">Morris Strickland</a> in the 6th, hit a three-run home run off <a href="../players/player_1686.html">Morris Strickland</a> in the 7th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_2101.html">Vernon O'Donnell</a> in the 8th.<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_1715.html">Boivin</a> is batting .321 with 6 home runs.
