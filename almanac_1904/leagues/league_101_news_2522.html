						The league commissioner announced that two players had been suspended for inappropriate conduct. He told BNN, "What I'm trying to do with these penalties is say, we can't stop you from doing these things, but if you do them, you have to understand you will pay the consequences."<br><br>Baseball can be an intense game and on-field confrontations happen. However, the league disciplinary policy is to punish, sometimes severely, those who decide to settle things with their fists.<br><br>When <a href="../players/player_1372.html">Sompong Voss</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou Frontenacs</a> and <a href="../players/player_574.html">Komkrit Allard</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a> got into a scuffle during a game, both players knew that a suspension would be forthcoming.<br><br>Sure enough, today it was announced that both players will each receive a 4-game suspension for their actions in a recent game at West Side Grounds.<br><br>On the season, <a href="../players/player_1372.html">Voss</a> is batting .317 with no home runs and 37 RBIs. He has played in 73 games.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_574.html">Allard</a> has fashioned a 6-16 mark, 3.84 ERA and pitched 201.2 innings. Opposing clubs are batting .284 against him and he has logged 78 strikeouts.
