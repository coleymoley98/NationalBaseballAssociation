						Like that comical chap in "The Mikado," <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a> pitcher <a href="../players/player_244.html">Lamarcus Madison</a> has "got a little list." More specifically, it's a little book in which he has started to keep a list of all the batters he has faced, along with notes on how to pitch to them. Madison first got the idea while in the minors, and it has helped him so much he wonders why more pitchers haven't adopted a similar expedient. "Every batter has a weakness," says the left--hander, "and once I figure it out, it goes in the book."<br><br>The manager of the Nordiques, <a href="../coaches/coach_79.html">Frédéric Lévesque</a>, approves of his hurler's approach to his craft. "I see him studying that book before every game and he's always making notations in it. He'll have the dope on every player in the league before the season's done." Others, however, are less impressed. <a href="../players/player_327.html">Roland Pelletier</a> of the Montreal Royales, whose name may or may not appear on the list, noted that "every pitcher does something like that, but the brainier ones keep all that information in their heads." The first baseman added tartly: "I suspect that Madison has to carry around a book because otherwise he'd forget everything that's in it."
