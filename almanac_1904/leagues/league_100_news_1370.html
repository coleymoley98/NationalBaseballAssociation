						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_57.html">Alexandre Laroche</a> as he led the charge to a 7-3 win over the Redcoats. The <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a> left fielder was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Boston</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 5 hits in 6 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_57.html">Laroche</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said <a href="../coaches/coach_1.html">Herb Lamaison</a>, manager for the Redcoats, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_57.html">Alexandre Laroche</a> flied out in the 1st, singled in the 4th, singled in the 6th, singled in the 8th, hit an RBI single in the 9th and hit a two-run single in the 11th.<br><br>Thus far in 1896 Laroche is hitting .426 with 1 home run, 27 RBIs, 20 runs scored and has compiled a .464 OBP.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_49.html">View Boxscore</a>
