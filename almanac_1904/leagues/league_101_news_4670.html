						National League announced the start of the free agency period today.<br><br>Players with expiring contracts began to file as the clock struck midnight and general managers were already making the rounds. With the opening of free agency came a predictable chorus of speculation from the media.<br><br>While most teams are likely to make at least some small moves, it's still uncertain who the movers and shakers will be. Reporters expect a lot of attention to be lavished on the cream of the free agent crop, including these players:<br><br><br><a href="../players/player_265.html">Bhumibol Bernard</a>, 32 year-old CF<br><a href="../players/player_964.html">Mark Potter</a>, 25 year-old CF<br><a href="../players/player_1373.html">Jake Gillespie</a>, 31 year-old LF<br><a href="../players/player_54.html">Kantapong Barnes</a>, 27 year-old 3B<br><a href="../players/player_891.html">Alex Lopes</a>, 28 year-old CF<br><a href="../players/player_851.html">Jaxon Horder</a>, 26 year-old RH RP<br><a href="../players/player_653.html">Alexis Shinn</a>, 27 year-old RH CL<br><a href="../players/player_772.html">Ratipong Allard</a>, 28 year-old 2B<br><a href="../players/player_1039.html">Maxwell Tung</a>, 26 year-old CF<br><a href="../players/player_183.html">Sirisak Winter</a>, 35 year-old 1B<br><br>Signings can continue throughout the offseason, although most of the high quality players are expected to conclude negotiations long before then. Most players want to be well paid, but they also want to get settled so they can start the process of moving family across town or across the country.
