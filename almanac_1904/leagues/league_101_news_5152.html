						The <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou Frontenacs</a> manager was philosophical in the clubhouse following a shutout loss to the <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal Royales</a>. The Frontenacs were overpowered by Montreal starter <a href="../players/player_1252.html">Fabien Girard</a>, who hurled his club to victory, 9-0.<br><br>"It was just one of those games -- shake it off and do better next time," <a href="../coaches/coach_154.html">Mustafa Campeau</a> said.<br><br>Over 9 innings, Girard blanked Chicagou on 6 hits with no walks and 5 strikeouts.<br><br>"I kept them off balance. I could tell a lot of them were late on fastballs because they were fouling them off. Once you see that, it sets them up for other pitches," Girard said.<br><br>"I set them up, where if they chased one breaking ball, they were going to chase another one."<br><br>On his stats sheet this season <a href="../players/player_1252.html">Girard</a> shows a 11-4 record, 17 starts, 145 innings, 97 strikeouts and a 2.11 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_524.html">View Boxscore</a>
