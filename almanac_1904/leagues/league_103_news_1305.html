The <a href="../teams/team_86.html">Juneau Juniors</a> shortstop was red-hot, the ball just exploding off his bat all day.<br><br>"I don't try to hit homers," he said later. "I try to go out there and put a good swing on the ball, and sometimes it is going to go out of the park. I didn't try to hit the first one or the second one or the third one."<br><br>For the game, he went 3-for-6 with 5 RBIs and 3 runs scored.<br><br>"Too much <a href="../players/player_1010.html">Jean-François Corbeil</a> today," Juniors manager <a href="../coaches/coach_128.html">Dechanan Richardson</a> said.
