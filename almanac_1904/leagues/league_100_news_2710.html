						For the newcomer to professional baseball, today's amateur draft is a rite of passage. Every young player in the country is filtered through the draft pool, assessed, reassessed, scrutinized and run through several mock drafts even before they get to the real thing. But on draft day, once you've been picked, you have a shot to do what so few men in history have done, become a Canadian League ballplayer. <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a>, <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a>, <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a> and <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec</a> will have the first five picks. The top ten players, as rated by BNN, are:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_621.html">Stephen Huseman</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_514.html">Remington Fowler</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1325.html">Ara Frey</a>, 18 year-old 1B out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_510.html">Philippe Duquesne</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_689.html">Von Rivera</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1227.html">Narakorn Lelu</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_1080.html">Clement Wong</a>, 19 year-old C out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1364.html">Garland Givan</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_649.html">Joseph Coon</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.
