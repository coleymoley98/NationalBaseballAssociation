						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Saturday, August 7th, 1897</span><br>
						Canadian League announced the 1897 amateur draft pool today, a scant 90 days in advance of the actual draft. For scouts, it is the toughest challenge of the season, trying to come up with an educated guess as to what a young man in his late teens or early twenties is going to do at the professional level a good five years down the road, at best. Some will go on gut instincts; some will rely on years of experience; but most will find it disconcerting how much their team is beholden to Lady Luck. Choose well and they are geniuses; choose poorly and they are unemployed.<br><br>A complete rundown of the draft list is available in the Transactions area for quick reference and will be available 90 days before the draft.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_512.html">William Davison</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1057.html">Seth DiClemente</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1143.html">Muangkan Fawley</a>, 18 year-old LF out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_702.html">Pete Cannatelli</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1136.html">Prayad Windsor</a>, 18 year-old C out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_585.html">Kevin Joly</a>, 20 year-old SS out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_495.html">A.J. Desjardins</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_646.html">Fabrice Hardy</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_452.html">Kittipong Jones</a>, 21 year-old LHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_651.html">Jonathan Johnston</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
