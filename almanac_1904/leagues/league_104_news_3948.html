"I knew from the fifth inning that I had a no-hitter working. I tried to get it out of my mind, but you just can't. They have too many scoreboards in the park. They're everywhere you look."<br><br>The right-hander faced only 29 batters in the no-hit gem, struck out 9 and walked 2.<br><br>"We simply couldn't get any wood on the ball," Providence manager <a href="../coaches/coach_109.html">Luke Cairns</a> said when asked about the epic performance. "<a href="../players/player_1273.html">Strong</a> was brilliant out there. He certainly had our number."<br><br>Thus far this season, <a href="../players/player_1273.html">Strong</a> has tossed 33 innings in 5 starts, fanned 35 batters, walked 10 and put up a 3.82 ERA with 1 win and 3 losses.
