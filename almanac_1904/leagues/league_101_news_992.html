						Today at Ballpark of Quebec, <a href="../players/player_41.html">Kantapol Graybeal</a> put on an impressive display. <br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal Royales</a> center fielder tagged <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec</a> pitching for 5 hits in 5 at-bats, but his teammates were unable to capitalize on the spree and lost the game to the <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a> by the score of 7-5.<br><br>"The loss takes some of the joy out of it, but I'll take it," Graybeal said. "5-for-5 ain't bad in any league."<br><br>Despite the terrific performance, the Royales manager was unwilling to offer his center fielder much praise, saying he holds his "whole roster" accountable for losses.<br><br>"Kantapol told me 'Coach, I had 5 hits' and I said 'Well that's great, but it looks like we needed one more from you,'" manager Charles Read said.<br><br><a href="../players/player_41.html">Kantapol Graybeal</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, hit an RBI double in the 5th, hit an RBI triple in the 7th and singled in the 9th. <br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_41.html">Graybeal</a> is swinging the bat at a .311 pace. He has hit 3 home runs and scored 42 times, while driving in 24. His on-base percentage is .357 and he has played in 50 games.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_363.html">View Boxscore</a>
