						After a 5-hit effort to lead <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a>'s 13-1 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a>,  first baseman <a href="../players/player_712.html">Aaron Sanders</a> told BNN beat writers it had been "a special day."<br><br>"It really doesn't matter whether it's sandlot ball, high school or college, two hits in a game is nice," he said. "Three or four is better, but five or more is out of sight. And to do that at the National League-level is really something special." <br><br>The 25-year-old player earned his accolades today at West Side Grounds with a spectacular 5-for-5 game against the Nordiques. <br><br>"His swing is getting there," said Frontenacs skipper Mustafa Campeau, who spoke glowingly of <a href="../players/player_712.html">Sanders</a> after the game. "We want him to be quick with his swing, short and compact. We want him to be patient and go the other way when he can. <a href="../players/player_712.html">Aaron</a> did that to perfection today." <br><br><a href="../players/player_712.html">Aaron Sanders</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, tripled in the 5th, singled in the 6th and singled in the 8th.<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_712.html">Sanders</a> is batting .295 with 2 home runs.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_490.html">View Boxscore</a>
