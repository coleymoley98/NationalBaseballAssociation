And you're ready."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1033.html">Jules Tremblay</a> singled in the 1st, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, hit an RBI double in the 5th, hit a two-run single in the 6th and singled in the 8th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_1033.html">Tremblay</a> is currently batting .500 with no home runs and 7 RBIs.
