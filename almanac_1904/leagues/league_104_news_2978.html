						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, June 28th, 1899</span><br>
						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_484.html">Zach Bellefleur</a> as he led the charge to a 19-6 win over the Juniors. The <a href="../teams/team_76.html">Halifax</a> shortstop was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_81.html">Pawtucket</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 5 hits in 6 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_484.html">Bellefleur</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said <a href="../coaches/coach_106.html">Jetrin Charron</a>, manager for the Juniors, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_484.html">Zach Bellefleur</a> hit an RBI single in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, flied out in the 4th, singled in the 6th, hit a two-run single in the 7th and hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_1293.html">Sammy Ishida</a> in the 8th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_484.html">Bellefleur</a> currently has a .317 batting average with 32 hits, 2 homers, 11 RBIs, 27 runs scored and a .397 OBP.
