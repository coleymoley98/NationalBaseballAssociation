						In a dominant outing, <a href="../players/player_1940.html">Tadhg Oulton</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_85.html">Quebec City Juniors</a> totally silenced the bats of the <a href="../teams/team_87.html">Sherbrooke Juniors</a>, finishing with a no-hitter.<br><br>In the Juniors' 4-0 victory, Oulton faced only 28 batters, surrendered no hits, had 11 strikeouts and 1 walk.<br><br>"Honestly, I didn't even know the situation was what it was until the seventh inning," Quebec City manager Leomar Durán said. "I happened to look up there to see how many hits we had gotten, and I happened to notice that they hadn't gotten any."<br><br>Commenting on the defeat, losing manager <a href="../coaches/coach_121.html">Lance Vandergriff</a> told reporters in the clubhouse that he had a "pretty simple" analysis of the game.<br><br>"The Juniors had all the hits and all the runs, so they won," he snapped. "But yeah, Oulton pitched a heck of a ballgame."<br><br>To date this season, <a href="../players/player_1940.html">Oulton</a> has registered 10 starts, 1-7 won-lost mark, 2.27 ERA, 71.1 IP, 65 strikeouts and 28 walks. Opposing teams have hit .248 against him.
