						<a href="../players/player_495.html">A.J. Desjardins</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_76.html">Halifax Juniors</a> touched all the bases today at Juniors Ballpark in the 18-13 victory over <a href="../teams/team_74.html">Springfield</a>, hitting for the cycle.<br><br>He teed off on Juniors pitching, collecting 1 single, 1 double, 1 triple and 1 home run. The feat is rare in baseball as it requires a game of no fewer than four hits and the unusual combination of a home run, which requires a batter to hit for some power -- and a triple, which requires a batter to have both speed and a favorable fall of the ball.<br><br>"The hardest part was the triple," Desjardins confessed after the game. "A lot has to go right. It's real easy to get greedy trying to stretch a double and get thrown out. It's really hard to get a three-bagger."<br><br>He finished the big day with 4 hits in 4 at-bats, 7 runs batted in, 2 runs scored -- and a place in the record books.<br><br><a href="../players/player_495.html">A.J. Desjardins</a> hit an RBI double in the 1st, hit a two-run triple in the 2nd, hit an RBI single in the 4th and hit a three-run home run off <a href="../players/player_1378.html">Suriyakarn Lavallée</a> in the 5th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_495.html">Desjardins</a> has hit at a .276 clip with 19 RBIs, 3 home runs and 14 runs scored. He has played in 28 games.
