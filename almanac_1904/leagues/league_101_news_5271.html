						Scrutiny begins early in the life of an amateur baseball player. Very likely it started while he was in high school. Scouts have traveled many miles to come up with a portfolio of players who have the potential to play in National League. It all comes to fruition on rookie draft day. It's a crapshoot. <a href="../teams/team_95.html">Juneau</a>, <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a>, <a href="../teams/team_94.html">St. Louis</a>, <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a> and <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a> will have the first five cracks at hitting the jackpot this year. According to most baseball analysts, these 10 draftees are most likely to be chosen in the early rounds:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_1672.html">James Belton</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1961.html">Jimmy Michell</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1914.html">Isariya Auer</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_2058.html">Ron Vigil</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1548.html">Tossakorn Weangsong</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1723.html">Christopher Berglin</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1964.html">Bobby Hatakeda</a>, 18 year-old CF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_2011.html">Terry Juneau</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1537.html">Evan Nichols</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1669.html">Sarawut St-Onge</a>, 21 year-old RF out of college.
