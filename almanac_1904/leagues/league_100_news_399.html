						What would you do after you had just won your 100th game? Run around Huntington Avenue Grounds doing cartwheels, jumping for joy and waving to the crowd? Well, maybe you and I would do that, but not <a href="../players/player_952.html">Jozie Rivière</a> -- that's not his way.<br><br>After he notched number 100, the 28-year-old <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a> hurler spoke to the press like he always has -- in a soft, quiet voice. He wasn't doing any cartwheels or even anything resembling a jump for joy. "Obviously it feels very good," Rivière commented. "To win this many games, you've got to have a lot of help."<br><br>Rivière got his milestone victory by beating the <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Boston Redcoats</a> 1-0. He held them to 4 hits in 10 innings and rung up 6 strikeouts with 1 walk.<br><br>After sharing his thoughts with the press, he went to the clubhouse. There he was greeted by the guys who had helped him get #100. His teammates drenched him and then gave him a rousing round of applause. That got to him -- for the first time today, Rivière's face broke into a big smile.<br><br>His lifetime totals give <a href="../players/player_952.html">Rivière</a> 100 victories and 87 defeats with a 3.04 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1195.html">View Boxscore</a>
