						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Sunday, June 7th, 1896</span><br>
						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_16.html">Rory Till</a> as he led the charge to a 9-8 win over the Rebels. The <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Boston</a> center fielder was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 5 hits in 6 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_16.html">Till</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said <a href="../coaches/coach_44.html">Antoine Morissette</a>, manager for the Rebels, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_16.html">Rory Till</a> singled in the 1st, flied out in the 2nd, doubled in the 4th, hit an RBI double in the 5th, singled in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>In his season totals, <a href="../players/player_16.html">Till</a> has no home runs, .556 BA, .564 OBP, 5 RBIs and 8 runs scored. He has played in 8 games.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_72.html">View Boxscore</a>
