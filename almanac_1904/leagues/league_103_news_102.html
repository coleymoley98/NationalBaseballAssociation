						If there wasn't a history between <a href="../players/player_2065.html">Harvey McDonald</a> of <a href="../teams/team_84.html">Sainte-Paul</a> and <a href="../players/player_2131.html">Brad Birdal</a> of <a href="../teams/team_88.html">Gauthier</a>, then there is one now. The incident between the two sparked a bench-clearing scrum with those two being the center of attention. Now they will miss 4 and 2 games respectively as a result of their actions. The league office announced their suspensions today.<br><br>"We're both really competitive," <a href="../players/player_2065.html">McDonald</a> said later, "and sometimes things go a little too far because of it."<br><br>Presently <a href="../players/player_2065.html">McDonald</a> is hitting .287 with 11 home runs and 26 RBIs. He has played in 38 games and scored 38 times.<br><br><a href="../players/player_2131.html">Birdal</a> has taken the mound for 10 relief appearances this season, nailing down no saves while notching a 2-0 record with a 10.02 ERA. The <a href="../teams/team_88.html">Gauthier</a> reliever has limited opposing batters to a .410 batting average.
