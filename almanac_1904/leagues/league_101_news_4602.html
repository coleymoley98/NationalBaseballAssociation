						The biggest anxiety for 1902 new young players is getting drafted. For the young man with something to prove, simple entrance into the draft does not guarantee a big league contract. Some will suffer the excruciating torment of having to stand by as their competitors get picked before them, hoping that they get a slim chance to prove their skills anywhere. At any rate, teams now have 90 days to scout the draft pool before the draft is held.<br><br>The Transactions page also gets a new section dedicated to the draft pool, which will be available for 90 days prior to the draft.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_1931.html">Daniel Glaive</a>, 17 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1963.html">Vilas Promrak</a>, 17 year-old SS out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1286.html">Wes Malone</a>, 21 year-old LF out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_1485.html">Ronald Rice</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1522.html">Chatchawal Srithong</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1255.html">Emrick Dagenais</a>, 21 year-old 2B out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1746.html">Dermot Pilkington</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_696.html">Adrian Laflamme</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1259.html">Justin Toppin</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1792.html">Conley Millage</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
