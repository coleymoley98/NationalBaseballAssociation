						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Saturday, November 5th, 1898</span><br>
						For players entering the 1898 draft today, there is nothing quite like the anticipation of being picked. And yet, the draft is unsettling to one and all. Almost from the first, things go haywire. Promises and mock drafts go up the chimney. To the young rookie, the pressure ends upon his selection, if only for a short interlude before reality sets in. <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a>, <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal</a>, <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a>, <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec</a> are the first five teams to pick this year. BNN has predicted these players to be among the first ten selected:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_621.html">Stephen Huseman</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_514.html">Remington Fowler</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1325.html">Ara Frey</a>, 18 year-old 1B out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_689.html">Von Rivera</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1364.html">Garland Givan</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_510.html">Philippe Duquesne</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1227.html">Narakorn Lelu</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_649.html">Joseph Coon</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1080.html">Clement Wong</a>, 19 year-old C out of college.
