						Around the clubhouse they call him "Doc," but now <a href="../players/player_206.html">C.J. Dills</a> has the diploma to prove it. The <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou Frontenacs</a>'s reliever has always had the reputation as one of the brainiest players in the circuit, but most folks were unaware that the native of Magog, The United Provinces was taking night classes at the Millard College School of Dentistry in Chicagou, often departing immediately from West Side Grounds to attend a lecture. "There was one time after an extra-inning game when I didn't even have time to change out of my uniform," Dills recalled. "That got me some funny looks from my professor, I can assure you." Asked what sparked his interest in the dental profession, he replied: "my dad was an old-fashioned tooth-puller back in the day, and I was just lucky to have the chance to get the kind of education and professional training that he lacked."<br><br>Armed with his newly minted DDS degree, Dills plans to put that training into practice by openng a dental office back in his hometown during the offseason, and he already is setting his sights further down the road. "A baseball player's career only lasts so long," he notes, "and a fellow has to have something solid to fall back on once he retires from baseball." Dills summed it up this way: "dentistry is about as steady as it gets - some jobs come and go, but people will always have teeth."
