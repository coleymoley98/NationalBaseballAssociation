						The <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Boston Redcoats</a> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia</a> at Exposition Park. One in particular -- <a href="../players/player_1348.html">Wittaya Soijit</a>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Redcoats first baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.<br><br>But the disgruntled Soijit lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.<br><br>But it got worse after the game, when Soijit told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."<br><br>For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Soijit for 2 games.<br><br><a href="../players/player_1348.html">Soijit</a> is presently hitting at a .309 pace with no home runs and 25 RBIs. He has played in 53 games and scored 28 times.
