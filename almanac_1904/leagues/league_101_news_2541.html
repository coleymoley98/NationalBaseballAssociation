						One of the highlights of the year happened today at Montreal Grounds when <a href="../players/player_824.html">Garrett Foreman</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal</a> Royales broke the season mark for strikeouts. <a href="../players/player_824.html">Foreman</a> got his 126th strikeouts to break the old record set by <a href="../players/player_949.html">Jayden Queen</a>. For his epic achievement he received an extended ovation by the fans that lasted several minutes. "Most of the time I just try to get the batter to hit my pitch. It's more efficient that way and you can go deeper into the game. Strikeouts demand more pitches, more stamina and can take a toll on your arm. I knew I was close to the season record today, so I was really psyched up for Ks. I wanted to get the record chasing over and done with and my name in the record book."<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_824.html">Foreman</a> has worked 246 innings with 126 strikeouts en route to a 14-9 record and a 2.20 ERA.
