The <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia Liberty</a> snatched the victory, topping the Redcoats by a score of 11-6.<br><br>"Well that wasn't how it was supposed to end," Johnson said later. "I'll just have to do it again and get it right."<br><br><a href="../players/player_10.html">Grandy Johnson</a> singled in the 2nd, grounded out in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 5th, singled in the 7th, singled in the 9th and singled in the 10th.<br><br>Thus far this season Johnson is hitting .395 with 2 home runs, 40 RBIs and 36 runs scored.
