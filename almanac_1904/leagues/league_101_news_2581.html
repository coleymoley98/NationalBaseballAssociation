						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Sunday, August 7th, 1898</span><br>
						The 1898 amateur draft pool was published today with barely a mention on BNN. But then, fans rarely get drawn into amateur drafts. The players are not known commodities and they're not tangible, recognizable names. They might be five years down the road, but casual fans don't get sucked in by "might be," they get excited about what is happening in the here and now. Over the next 30 days, scouts will assess their possibilities, run mock drafts and formulate their plans.<br><br>To help them, National League has posted an interactive draft section on its Transactions page, which will be available for 90 days before draft day.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_514.html">Remington Fowler</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_689.html">Von Rivera</a>, 20 year-old CF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_621.html">Stephen Huseman</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_1325.html">Ara Frey</a>, 18 year-old 1B out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1227.html">Narakorn Lelu</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_364.html">Shane Kondratenko</a>, 24 year-old CF out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a>, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_1364.html">Garland Givan</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_510.html">Philippe Duquesne</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_649.html">Joseph Coon</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
