"He got hitters' counts."<br><br><a href="../players/player_987.html">Watkins</a> agreed, saying that getting ahead early in the counts was "the key" to his game.<br><br>"Once you get ahead, it makes it a lot easier because you get a better pitch to hit," he said. "You know the pitcher has to come in with it. And you're ready."<br><br><a href="../players/player_987.html">Vince Watkins</a> grounded out in the 1st, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, singled in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 6th, hit an RBI double in the 8th and singled in the 10th.<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_987.html">Watkins</a> has no home runs and a .284 batting average. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_126.html">View Boxscore</a>
