						<a href="../players/player_1404.html">Bill Scot Rigsbee</a> was at the head of a <a href="../teams/team_68.html">Drummondville Juniors</a> hit parade today at Gauthier Grounds.

"Bill Scot did fine, but as a team, we didn't do it with the bats and we didn't do it pitching."<br><br>Rigsbee did more than fine, dominating the Juniors at the plate during his record-making 5-for-6 performance.<br><br>"Each time I went to the plate, I was thinking about hitting the ball hard somewhere," the sweet-swinging right fielder told reporters. "When I focus on that, I usually have quality at-bats."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1404.html">Bill Scot Rigsbee</a> struck out in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, hit an RBI single in the 4th, singled in the 6th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_1404.html">Rigsbee</a> is batting .344 with no home runs.
