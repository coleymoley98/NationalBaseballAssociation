						"They said it was all in my head, and I guess they were right after all!" So stated <a href="../players/player_1027.html">Nigel Henderson</a>, hurler for the <a href="../teams/team_95.html">Juneau</a>, speaking to reporters after announcing that he would soon undergo some much-needed dental work in an effort to remedy his pitching woes. "The doc says I got a couple of impacted wisdom teeth, so I figured I'd take care of them in the offseason."<br><br>Brasseurs pitching coach <a href="../coaches/coach_175.html">Branson Gillion</a>, who can be credited with discovering the linkage between the jawbone and the arm bone, told the press "I've seen it all before. A fella gets to thinking about his teeth, and the next thing you know he forgets all about the game." Gillion reckons that the treatment might help by adding some velocity to Henderson's fastball. Proclaimed the left- hander: "if the doc can put some mustard on my heater, I don't care if he takes out all my teeth!"
