						Rebels starting pitcher <a href="../players/player_45.html">Jordan Christian</a> remains hospitalized today after suffering head and back injuries as the result of a fall from his rooftop 2 days ago. However, his condition has been upgraded from critical to serious and he has been steadily improving over the last 36 hours, according to a hospital spokesperson. Initial fears were that Jordan Christian may have suffered neurological and spinal cord damage, which could have resulted in paralysis. As of today, those concerns have diminished substantially. "The head injury doesn't appear to be as serious as we originally thought and there doesn't appear to be any permanent damage to the spine," said team doctor Wesley Lévêque. "The bad news is that he has suffered a broken back, which should eventually heal, but may jeopardize his playing career. We'll just have to wait and see. For now, though, we just need to keep him stabilized and make sure no unforeseen complications arise. You have to be cautious with these types up injuries."
