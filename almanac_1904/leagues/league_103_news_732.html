Fortunately, things went our way in the ballgame today and we came away with a win."<br><a href="../players/player_886.html">David McQueen</a> flied out in the 1st, singled in the 4th, grounded out in the 6th and grounded out in the 9th.<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_886.html">McQueen</a> has gotten 40 hits in 106 at-bats for a .377 batting average with 5 home runs.
