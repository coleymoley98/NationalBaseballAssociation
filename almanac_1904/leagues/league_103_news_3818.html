						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, April 17th, 1901</span><br>
						<a href="../players/player_1585.html">Kitti Audet</a> was feeling calm about his no-hitter -- until the last three outs.<br><br>"You really become conscious of every pitch at that point," he said. "The adrenaline level kicks up even higher. Everybody in the ballpark knows a no-hitter is on the line. The crowd is on its feet. One mistake and it's all over."<br><br>There were no mistakes to be had for Audet on this day at Field of the Juniors. The <a href="../teams/team_87.html">Sherbrooke Juniors</a> right-hander was in complete command, not allowing the <a href="../teams/team_91.html">Davenport Juniors</a> a single base hit in the 17-0 victory.<br><br>"Obviously, you never think this will happen," he said to BNN reporters after the game. "I don't know if it's really sunk in yet."<br><br>Audet faced 32 batters, had 7 strikeouts and gave up 4 walks in a dominating effort.<br><br>"He was on from the get-go," Juniors manager <a href="../coaches/coach_128.html">Dechanan Richardson</a> said. "He was hitting his spots and keeping us off balance. It was a great game by him."<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_1585.html">Audet</a> is batting .275 with no home runs.
