						It may have been the most consequential load of laundry in the history of the national pastime. It was certainly a major calamity for <a href="../players/player_244.html">Lamarcus Madison</a>, the pitcher for the   who famously kept a book that detailed the weaknesses of every batter that he had faced. "Kept" is the key word here, for when the hurler recently sent out his uniform for washing, he forgot that his precious aide memoire was still in the back pocket of his pants. Upon the return of his newly laundered habiliments, Madison discovered the tattered remains of his magnum opus, thoroughly cleansed of all its contents. "The pages were all soaked and the ink had washed away," he lamented, adding that "it's like leaving a cake out in the rain - and I'll never have that recipe again!"<br><br>The sad tale of the book's demise lends credence to the speculation that Madison only kept the list in the first place because he was too forgetful to remember those details on his own. Surely, if he'd had a better memory, he would have remembered to take the book out of his pants pocket before sending his uniform out to the laundress.
