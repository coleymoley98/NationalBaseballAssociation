						Anyone can take it easy during the offseason, after all, baseball has one of the longest seasons in professional sports. That didn't stop New York Rebels' right fielder from going above and beyond this offseason in an effort to increase his all around game. Said <a href="../players/player_102.html">Perrault</a>, "I have been spending hours on the field each day, trying to make sure I play the best RF I can. Shagging flies, taking grounders, and doing sprints. I really want to increase my range." <br><br><a href="../players/player_102.html">Perrault</a>'s Manager, <a href="../coaches/coach_15.html">Tyrone Martin</a>, recently attended one of these work out sessions and was impressed. Said <a href="../coaches/coach_15.html">Martin</a>, "<a href="../players/player_102.html">Jabari</a> has really put in a lot of work on the field and it definitely shows. He gets to the ball quicker and makes better plays."
