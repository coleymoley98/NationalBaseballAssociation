						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_466.html">Kiatisuk Sanders</a> as he led the charge to a 13-3 win over the Rebels. The <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia</a> center fielder was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 5 hits in 5 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_466.html">Sanders</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said <a href="../coaches/coach_15.html">Tyrone Martin</a>, manager for the Rebels, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_466.html">Kiatisuk Sanders</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, hit an RBI single in the 6th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_466.html">Sanders</a> is batting .364 with 1 home run.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_103.html">View Boxscore</a>
