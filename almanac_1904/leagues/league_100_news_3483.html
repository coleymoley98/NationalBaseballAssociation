						If there is a bigger "fan" of the Toronto Blue Sox than Mike "That's Awl" McGonigle, let that man come forward and present his bona fides. Until that unlikely day, the crown will remain securely atop the bean of McGonigle, the proprietor of the Home Plate Saloon, which is located just steps from Canadian League Park I, the home of the <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Blue Sox</a>. The garulous son of Erin, whose knowledge of baseball is positively encyclopedic, is famous for bringing arguments about the game to a conclusion with a definitive "that's awl!"<br><br>But it is his activity outside the walls of his establishment that earn him the accolades of Toronto fandom. McGonigle has organized a club known as the "Ancient and Loyal Order of Rooters," which cheers on the Blue Sox both at home and even abroad. At five-score strong and growing by the day, the Loyal Rooters boom for their favorite team like no one has boomed before, and club owner <a href="../coaches/coach_85.html">Anan Morency</a> encourages them with free passes and choice seats to the games. "I'm delighted that Mike and his pals are so enthusiastic," the magnate told reporters. "It's a fine organization and I'm pleased to be able to help out in any way that I can. As I see it, this increased interest cannot but redound to the benefit of the club."
