						The <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia Liberty</a> stopped the <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York Rebels</a> by a score of 17-14 at Exposition Park today, with the lion's share of the credit going to left fielder <a href="../players/player_21.html">T.J. Freed</a>. The 36-year-old had a career day, collecting 5 hits.<br><br>"Every batter wants to have a quality at-bat every time he steps up to the plate," Freed said later. "He wants to hit the ball hard."<br><br>Freed did just that in his 6 at-bats, much to the chagrin of the Rebels.<br><br>"Not much that I can say," offered New York manager <a href="../coaches/coach_44.html">Antoine Morissette</a>. "He just hammered the heck out of us." <br><br><a href="../players/player_21.html">T.J. Freed</a> flied out in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, hit an RBI single in the 4th, singled in the 5th, singled in the 6th and hit a two-run single in the 7th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_21.html">Freed</a> is hitting .318 with 2 home runs and 29 RBIs to his credit. He has gotten on base at a .386 clip and scored 33 runs.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_75.html">View Boxscore</a>
