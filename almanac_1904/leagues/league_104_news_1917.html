"It was like all I had to do was close my eyes and swing the bat."<br><br>In a game headed for the record books, Liles banged out 5 hits in 5 at-bats and totaled 2 RBI and 4 runs scored. Speaking with the press about the feat, he attributed it to "a lot of luck."<br><br>"A triple is so hard to hit," he said. "To just decide to get one in a game when you need it for a cycle, it's impossible. Usually something weird has to happen, the ball kicking past an outfielder or somebody falling down. There's a ton of luck in hitting for a cycle."<br><br><a href="../players/player_690.html">Daquein Liles</a> singled in the 1st, hit an RBI triple in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, doubled in the 7th and hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_618.html">Micah Farnborough</a> in the 8th.<br><br>So far this season, <a href="../players/player_690.html">Liles</a> has recorded a .400 batting average with 20 hits, 1 home run, 11 RBIs, 14 runs scored and a .436 OBP.
