						With the rookie draft only weeks away, clubs are huddled in their conference rooms, mapping out scouting strategies with their eye toward the future. These sabermetrical speculators will be traipsing across the fruited plain, hunting for the ideal find, trying to decipher the will, drive and pure passion on the unknown youthful faces before them. Some will rely on tried-and-true baseball knowledge, others psychology. And others will live by luck alone. Though their final assessments will be made and hashed over many times before draft day, the repercussions of draft day, good or bad, will endure long after the dust has settled. <br><br>At any rate, teams now have thirty days to scout the draft pool prior to the draft. The Transactions page also gets a new section dedicated to the pool.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_1414.html">Prak U-chareon</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1456.html">Hafit Che-moh</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1587.html">Timothy Wilkins</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_1635.html">Suthep Aiton</a>, 17 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1441.html">Arthur Joly</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1252.html">Fabien Girard</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1431.html">Samuel St-Jacques</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_67.html">Joshua Ouellet</a>, 17 year-old LHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1629.html">Dan McNeill</a>, 17 year-old SS out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1348.html">Wittaya Soijit</a>, 19 year-old 2B out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
