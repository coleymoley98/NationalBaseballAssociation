						The <a href="../teams/team_94.html">St. Louis Cardinaux</a> manager was philosophical in the clubhouse following a shutout loss to the <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a>. The Cardinaux were overpowered by Detroit starter <a href="../players/player_452.html">Kittipong Jones</a>, who hurled his club to victory, 5-0.<br><br>"It was just one of those games -- shake it off and do better next time," <a href="../coaches/coach_161.html">Andy Bernatchez</a> said.<br><br>Over 9 innings, Jones blanked St. Louis on 6 hits with 2 walks and 2 strikeouts.<br><br>"I kept them off balance. I could tell a lot of them were late on fastballs because they were fouling them off. Once you see that, it sets them up for other pitches," Jones said.<br><br>"I set them up, where if they chased one breaking ball, they were going to chase another one."<br><br>This year in 10 starts, <a href="../players/player_452.html">Jones</a> has recorded 5 wins and absorbed 5 losses. He has pitched 88.1 innings, allowed 84 hits, struck out 30 and has a 2.65 ERA.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_331.html">View Boxscore</a>
