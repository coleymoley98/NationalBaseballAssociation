						<a href="../players/player_1927.html">Logan Fréchette</a> was at the head of a <a href="../teams/team_87.html">Sherbrooke</a> hit parade today at Gauthier Grounds. The first baseman went to the plate 6 times and came away with 5 hits, sparking the Juniors to a 12-8 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_88.html">Gauthier Juniors</a>. <br><br>"I told the guys in the dugout, just be thinking about hitting the ball hard somewhere," the sweet-swinging Fréchette told reporters after the game. "Seems like it worked out well for us today."<br><br>Juniors skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_133.html">Ti Holley</a> said later that the club gave up "too much plate." <br><br>"Not the way we planned it," he said. "Every hitter in the league will rip you when you do that."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1927.html">Logan Fréchette</a> singled in the 1st, hit a two-run single in the 2nd, grounded out in the 5th, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_2129.html">Kraison Ruder</a> in the 7th, singled in the 8th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_2239.html">Adam Jones</a> in the 10th, walked in the 12th and walked in the 14th.<br><br>Fréchette is currently batting .250 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs and 4 runs scored. He has 10 hits in 40 at-bats.
