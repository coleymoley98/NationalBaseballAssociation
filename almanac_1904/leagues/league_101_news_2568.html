						The <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a> downed the <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou Frontenacs</a> 14-13 today at West Side Grounds, in spite of the best efforts of Chicagou center fielder <a href="../players/player_537.html">John Rieth</a>. Rieth lashed the ball all over the park in a 5-hit explosion, finishing with a 5-for-6 line -- and a loss. <br><br>"I don't remember a better day batting, but it sure is disappointing to lose the game," he said to BNN reporters in the postgame interview. "A win would have made the day much sweeter."<br><br>Asked if he would adjust his strategy next time the Lions face Rieth, Detroit manager <a href="../coaches/coach_57.html">Enzo Kelly</a> said "absolutely not."<br><br>"Our strategy was to not give him good pitches to hit," he said. "We didn't do that, and he worked us over. Thankfully, we won anyway, and next time we'll pitch to him better."<br><br><a href="../players/player_537.html">John Rieth</a> singled in the 1st, hit an RBI single in the 2nd, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, hit an RBI single in the 5th, grounded out in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>Thus far this season in 62 games Rieth is batting .313 with no home runs, 27 RBIs and 33 runs scored. He has 80 hits in 256 at-bats.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_386.html">View Boxscore</a>
