						The <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a> manager was philosophical in the clubhouse following a shutout loss to the <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal Royales</a>. The Lions were overpowered by Montreal starter <a href="../players/player_1070.html">Pat Eagan</a>, who hurled his club to victory, 1-0.<br><br>"It was just one of those games -- shake it off and do better next time," <a href="../coaches/coach_37.html">Adrian Miramontes</a> said.<br><br>Over 9 innings, Eagan blanked Detroit on 5 hits with 2 walks and 5 strikeouts.<br><br>"I kept them off balance. I could tell a lot of them were late on fastballs because they were fouling them off. Once you see that, it sets them up for other pitches," Eagan said.<br><br>"I set them up, where if they chased one breaking ball, they were going to chase another one."<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_1070.html">Eagan</a> has fashioned a 8-6 mark, 2.69 ERA and pitched 130.1 innings. Opposing clubs are batting .242 against him and he has logged 38 strikeouts. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_311.html">View Boxscore</a>
