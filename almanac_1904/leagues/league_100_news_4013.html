						<a href="../players/player_990.html">Hunter Jones</a> was at the head of a <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia Liberty</a> hit parade today at Exposition Park. The 25-year-old went to the plate 5 times and came away with 5 hits, but it was the <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto Blue Sox</a> that marched off with the 5-3 win.<br><br>"We didn't have it today," griped Liberty skipper Anisong Ilic following the game. "Hunter did fine, but as a team, we didn't do it with the bats and we didn't do it pitching."<br><br>Jones did more than fine, dominating the Blue Sox at the plate during his record-making 5-for-5 performance.<br><br>"Each time I went to the plate, I was thinking about hitting the ball hard somewhere," the sweet-swinging left fielder told reporters. "When I focus on that, I usually have quality at-bats."<br><br><a href="../players/player_990.html">Hunter Jones</a> hit an RBI single in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th and doubled in the 9th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_990.html">Jones</a> is batting .367 with 62 hits, 1 home run, 26 RBIs, .398 OBP and has scored 22 runs.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_133.html">View Boxscore</a>
