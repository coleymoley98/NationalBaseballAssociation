"Thankfully, we were able to do enough elsewhere that Lévy wasn't the difference."<br><br><a href="../players/player_2125.html">Isaac Lévy</a> hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_2153.html">Alex Turcotte</a> in the 2nd, grounded out in the 4th, singled in the 6th, singled in the 8th, walked in the 10th, singled in the 12th and singled in the 13th. <br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_2125.html">Lévy</a> has socked 9 hits in 17 at-bats for a .529 average with 1 home run. He is getting on base at a .579 pace and his totals also include 2 RBIs and 5 runs scored.
