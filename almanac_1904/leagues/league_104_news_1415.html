						It was a special day for <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a> at Juniors Ballpark -- the <a href="../teams/team_75.html">Fort Wayne Juniors</a> left fielder hit for the cycle, getting every type of hit possible.<br><br>The 18-year-old <a href="../players/player_739.html">Bouchard</a> racked up 2 singles, 1 double, 1 triple and 1 home run to get his name in the history books. It was all for naught, however, as the Juniors didn't win the ballgame, dropping the decision to the <a href="../teams/team_78.html">Quincy Juniors</a>, 15-13.<br><br>"He hit everything we threw," said Quincy manager <a href="../coaches/coach_110.html">Ethan Bax</a>. "There was just no getting him out today."<br><br>For the game, he was 5-for-6 with 2 RBI and 5 runs scored.<br><br>"I'm glad for <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan</a>," Fort Wayne manager Ace Dugandzic said. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing and a nice feather in his cap. Would've been better if we could have won the game for him, too."<br><br>Speaking to the press after the game, <a href="../players/player_739.html">Bouchard</a> said the key for his record-setting day was "just getting some good pitches to hit."<br><br><a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a> singled in the 1st, hit an RBI triple in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_449.html">Rattana Thethinee</a> in the 5th, flied out in the 7th and doubled in the 9th.<br><br>Bouchard is batting .340 this year with 1 home run, 6 RBIs and 12 runs scored. He has 18 hits in 53 at-bats.
