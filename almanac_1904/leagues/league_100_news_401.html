						Wolfeburg shortstop <a href="../players/player_885.html">Thitichot Troutman</a> lashed out at media today, accusing the local press of unfairly criticizing his manager and teammates during the team's recent slump. "I'm sick and tired of hearing how we lack hustle and how Steve (manager Steve Greene) isn't pushing us hard enough! We're busting our humps out there every game. It just hasn't been coming together for us lately. That's not Steve's fault. We're the ones out there on the field. We've just got to work through this," Troutman told reporters, adding "And we don't need your [expletive] remarks, either!" Teammate <a href="../players/player_400.html">Jeerawat Frémont</a> defended Troutman afterwards. "Thitichot is just a really passionate guy," Jeerawat Frémont explained. "He doesn't always choose his words carefully, but there's no questioning his loyalty or his heart. He just really hates losing, so he's obviously frustrated now, as we all are."
