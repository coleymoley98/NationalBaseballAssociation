						<a href="../players/player_702.html">Pete Cannatelli</a> is getting all kinds of endorsements regarding his future in the league, even from other teams.<br><br>One of those rare characters who possesses personal and professional skills that not only improve his team, Cannatelli is expected to improve the popularity and quality of the league and the sport of baseball. But there are questions about whether too much praise comes with a price.<br><br>"It's not always a good thing to slap a label on a kid, even if it's a good one," said Montreal manager <a href="../coaches/coach_51.html">Charles Read</a>. "There's no doubt in my mind that he has the leadership skills and maturity to become a great contributor, but writing award articles before there's any performance creates a lot of pressure to succeed. Even the dollar payoff doesn't offset stress, in fact it often just adds to it."<br><br>Cannatelli doesn't mind being called the future face of the franchise, but agrees that it means he has a lot to live up to.<br><br>"Hey, I will always do the best I can and do whatever's asked of me. Predictions are flattering, but they don't change what I am. They don't make be better or worse. I don't let it get in my head," he added. "If I let success get in there, then I'm bound to let failures get in there, too."<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal Royales</a> are certain that Cannatelli will fill up seats and provide a leadership role as the club continues to grow. Team owner, Adam Saro, summed it up when he remarked, "Pete is just the kind of investment good bankers make. You know, you absolutely know, it's going to pay dividends. You don't tinker with the goods, you just put all your resources into them and watch them grow. "
