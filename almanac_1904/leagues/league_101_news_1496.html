						Getting 4 hits in a game is no easy feat, but doing it to hit for the cycle is even more rare. <br><br><a href="../players/player_240.html">Nathan Shaw</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a> pulled it off today at Bennett Park, going 4-for-5 against the <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a>. His batting escapades sparked the Nordiques to a 15-10 victory.<br><br>Shaw tallied 3 runs and drove in 4 during the game. Hitting for the cycle is particularly rare because of the different skills required - enough power for a home run, enough speed for a triple and enough patience at the plate to see at least four hittable balls. <br><br>"It just happened," Shaw said to reporters after the win. "Must have been fate or something, I wasn't expecting it. Heck, I wasn't even really trying for it."<br><br><a href="../players/player_240.html">Nathan Shaw</a> doubled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, hit a two-run triple in the 6th, struck out in the 7th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_77.html">Kittiphan Mai</a> in the 8th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_240.html">Shaw</a> is batting at a .257 pace this season, picking up 57 hits in 222 at-bats with 6 home runs, 39 RBIs and 34 runs scored. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_349.html">View Boxscore</a>
