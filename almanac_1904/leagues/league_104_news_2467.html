						It's not something you read about in the sports pages every day -- a 5-for-7 day. For many, it might come around only once in a career -- and for <a href="../players/player_1168.html">Alexandre Pelletier</a>, it came around today. <br><br>The 19-year-old catcher scattered hits all over Juniors Ballpark to pace the <a href="../teams/team_73.html">Buffalo Juniors</a> to a 30-6 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_72.html">Toronto Juniors</a>. <br><br><a href="../teams/team_72.html">Toronto</a> skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_119.html">Samuel Sénécal</a> told reporters in the press room that "Pelletier deserves a hat-tip."<br><br>"He hit some good pitches against us," he said. "In fact, according to our scouting reports, Pelletier hit several that he is not supposed to be able to hit." <br><br><a href="../players/player_1168.html">Alexandre Pelletier</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_602.html">Siripong More</a> in the 2nd, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, walked in a run in the 4th, struck out in the 4th, struck out in the 6th and singled in the 8th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_1168.html">Pelletier</a> is batting .270 with 31 hits and 1 home run. He has scored 19 times and has batted in 18 runs.
