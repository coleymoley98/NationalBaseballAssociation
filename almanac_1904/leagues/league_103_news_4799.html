						<a href="../players/player_843.html">Sulaiman Boulanger</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_71.html">Gallant Juniors</a> touched all the bases today at Juniors Ballpark in the 9-2 victory over <a href="../teams/team_87.html">Sherbrooke</a>, hitting for the cycle.<br><br>He teed off on Juniors pitching, collecting 1 single, 1 double, 1 triple and 1 home run. The feat is rare in baseball as it requires a game of no fewer than four hits and the unusual combination of a home run, which requires a batter to hit for some power -- and a triple, which requires a batter to have both speed and a favorable fall of the ball.<br><br>"The hardest part was the triple," Boulanger confessed after the game. "A lot has to go right. It's real easy to get greedy trying to stretch a double and get thrown out. It's really hard to get a three-bagger."<br><br>He finished the big day with 4 hits in 5 at-bats, 3 runs batted in, 2 runs scored -- and a place in the record books.<br><br><a href="../players/player_843.html">Sulaiman Boulanger</a> doubled in the 1st, tripled in the 4th, struck out in the 5th, singled in the 7th and hit a three-run home run off <a href="../players/player_2045.html">Tristan Goudreau</a> in the 8th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_843.html">Boulanger</a> is batting .381 with 8 hits, 3 home runs, 11 RBIs, 2 walks, .435 OBP and has scored 5 runs.
