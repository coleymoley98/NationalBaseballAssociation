						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, August 7th, 1895</span><br>
						The biggest anxiety for 1895 new young players is getting drafted. For the young man with something to prove, simple entrance into the draft does not guarantee a big league contract. Some will suffer the excruciating torment of having to stand by as their competitors get picked before them, hoping that they get a slim chance to prove their skills anywhere. At any rate, teams now have 90 days to scout the draft pool before the draft is held.<br><br>The Transactions page also gets a new section dedicated to the draft pool, which will be available for 90 days prior to the draft.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_989.html">P.J. Meitner</a>, 18 year-old CF out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_537.html">John Rieth</a>, 20 year-old CF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_861.html">Dylan Proust</a>, 18 year-old CF out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_558.html">Naratorn Na</a>, 20 year-old CF out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_964.html">Mark Potter</a>, 18 year-old CF out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1011.html">Noam Migneault</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_417.html">Malik Hill</a>, 22 year-old RHP out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_824.html">Garrett Foreman</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_827.html">Adam Watson</a>, 19 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_811.html">Jesse Daniels</a>, 19 year-old 2B out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
