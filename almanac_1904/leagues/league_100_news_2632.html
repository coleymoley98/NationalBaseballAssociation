						<a href="../players/player_827.html">Adam Watson</a> of <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto</a> has done what few pitchers in the Canadian League have been able to do. He's won the Triple Crown, leading the league in all three major categories: wins, ERA and strikeouts. The <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Blue Sox</a> star finished 1898 with a 22-11 mark to pace the Canadian League in wins. He also posted a league best 2.21 ERA and topped the league with 134 strikeouts. A season good enough to put him as a strong favorite to take the CL Pitcher of the Year Award.<br><br>"His level of consistency is amazing," said the Blue Sox manager. "Adam goes out there every time he gets the ball and keeps you in the game. You know that when he's on the mound, you have an excellent chance at winning the game."<br><br>Watson is a low-key kind of guy. He is very proud of his wins, but not really excited about his unique accomplishment this season. He admitted to the press, "Maybe, just maybe, I'll look back on this Triple Crown when I retire and smile. But for now my stats are for my kids to brag about and for the media-types who love talking about numbers."
