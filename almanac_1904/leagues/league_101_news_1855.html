"I'm not sure if it was someone who knew I was a pro ballplayer or just a random thing, but it feel terrible either way."<br><br>Thankfully, Mai said, his family wasn't home during the incident.<br><br>"We can replace possessions, but no one was hurt, that's the main thing."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1078.html">Danny Hinck</a> said morale around the clubhouse is low, but they are trying to band together to help Mai through the situation.<br><br>"We're all bummed out, but happy he's OK and hopefully they can catch the guy who did this," he said.
