						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Monday, September 23rd, 1901</span><br>
						We're all familiar with the old saw "everyone loves a fireman," but after the heroic actions of <a href="../players/player_200.html">Nick Jones</a>, we may need to amend that phrase to read "everyone loves a center fielder." The tragic conflagration that recently occurred at the Palace Theatre in downtown Toronto has, of course, monopolized the headlines of newspapers across the country. During a performance of the hit musical comedy "The Fortune Teller," a fire broke out on the stage which quickly spread. Patrons trapped in the auditorium scrambled to find safe egress, with some forced to jump from windows to escape both the flames and the crush of the panicked crowd.<br><br>And that is where Jones enters the story. Walking down the street to meet with teammate <a href="../players/player_1033.html">Jules Tremblay</a> for a dinner engagement at the Belaire Hotel cafe, Jones heard the screams for help and, without thought to his own safety, rushed to the theatre. Seeing pretty young stenographer Dolly Dearborn dangling from a window ledge, he urged her to jump into his waiting arms. She did, and not a moment too soon. "I've made many catches on the ball field," Jones said afterwards, "but none was as big as the catch I made that night." He then helped to safety others who had been overcome by smoke.<br><br>Though not one to toot his own horn, it wasn't long before everyone had heard the news, and he suddenly found himself the most popular fellow in town. You can bet, then, that the cranks of this fair burg won't soon forget this, and will give Jones a mighty cheer when the <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto Blue Sox</a> take to the field again next season.
