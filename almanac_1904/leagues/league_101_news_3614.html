						Today is a day <a href="../players/player_621.html">Stephen Huseman</a> will be happy to forget after having made multiple errors in today's game. <br><br>"Look, I know I'm not the best fielder in the world but today was just embarrassing," <a href="../players/player_621.html">Huseman</a> said following the game. "I will definitely be doing some extra defensive work in the coming weeks. I really want to become a better defensive center fielder and I know I can."<br><br>Chicagou Frontenacs manager Mustafa Campeau didn't seem too concerned after the game, saying the club would be fine "as long as he doesn't make a habit of it."<br><br>"Everyone has one of those days where the ball just doesn't seem to find the mitt," Campeau said. "We'll keep an eye on it, but for now let's just say it was one of those things."
