He added 3 runs batted in and 4 runs scored to help Minneapolis take the Juniors Ballpark contest.<br><br>"It was the last thing on my mind, really," DiPaolo said. "I'm out there trying to get a blooper or a walk or whatever might help the team. Even if I had wanted to, hitting for the cycle is probably as much about luck as about skill anyway."<br><br><a href="../players/player_2081.html">Gerard DiPaolo</a> doubled in the 1st, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_1959.html">Nutthawat Ogburn</a> in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit an RBI triple in the 6th, walked in the 7th and struck out in the 9th.<br><br>Currently <a href="../players/player_2081.html">DiPaolo</a> is batting .344 with 8 home runs and 24 RBIs.
