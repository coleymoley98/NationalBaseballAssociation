						Rebels starting pitcher <a href="../players/player_45.html">Jordan Christian</a> was finally discharged from the hospital today after suffering a severe back injury 3 weeks ago. Jordan Christian stopped to talk to reporters as he was wheeled out to an awaiting car. "I just wanna thank my friends and family, my teammates, the people of New York, and all the Rebels fans around the world for their support and for keeping me in their prayers through this difficult time. And I especially want to thank all the doctors and hospital staff for doing such a good job taking care of me." Now comes the hard part for Jordan Christian. He will soon begin a long rehabilitation that may or may not allow him to resume his playing career. "Right now, I'm not thinking about that," said Christian when asked about his prospects for returning. "I've got a long road ahead of me. At this point, I'm just taking it one day at a time."
