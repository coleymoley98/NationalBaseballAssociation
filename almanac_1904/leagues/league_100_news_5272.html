						In the few hours remaining until the draft begins today, GMs across Canadian League will be penned up in their offices, making hurried last minute notes about each of their most coveted prospects. Fearful that things won't go as planned, many of them are still playing through the myriad scenarios that are all but certain to unfold in the high-stakes lottery of drafting. Scouting teams play devil's advocate, argue strategy back and forth and try to help their general manager gain the strategic upper hand, even though they know a lot of what transpires today will come down to being in the right place at the right time. BNN projects that the top picks of the draft will be:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_1672.html">James Belton</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1961.html">Jimmy Michell</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1914.html">Isariya Auer</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_2058.html">Ron Vigil</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1548.html">Tossakorn Weangsong</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1723.html">Christopher Berglin</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1964.html">Bobby Hatakeda</a>, 18 year-old CF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_2011.html">Terry Juneau</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1537.html">Evan Nichols</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1669.html">Sarawut St-Onge</a>, 21 year-old RF out of college.<br><br>These ballclubs will have the first five choices: <a href="../teams/team_94.html">St. Louis</a>, <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a>, <a href="../teams/team_95.html">Juneau</a>, <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto</a> and <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a>.
