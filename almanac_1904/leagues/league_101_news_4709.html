						Scrutiny begins early in the life of an amateur baseball player. Very likely it started while he was in high school. Scouts have traveled many miles to come up with a portfolio of players who have the potential to play in National League. It all comes to fruition on rookie draft day. It's a crapshoot. <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a>, <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal</a>, <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a>, <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec</a> will have the first five cracks at hitting the jackpot this year. According to most baseball analysts, these 10 draftees are most likely to be chosen in the early rounds:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_1931.html">Daniel Glaive</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1963.html">Vilas Promrak</a>, 18 year-old SS out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1485.html">Ronald Rice</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_1746.html">Dermot Pilkington</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1522.html">Chatchawal Srithong</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_696.html">Adrian Laflamme</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1792.html">Conley Millage</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_1255.html">Emrick Dagenais</a>, 21 year-old 2B out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1259.html">Justin Toppin</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1286.html">Wes Malone</a>, 21 year-old LF out of college.
