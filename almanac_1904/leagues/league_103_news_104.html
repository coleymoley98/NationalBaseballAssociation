						For once, it was the <a href="../teams/team_89.html">Coude Juniors</a> picking up the slack for <a href="../players/player_2136.html">Bowie Moore</a>.<br><br>The club's "offensive catalyst," as Coude manager Cole Siller has frequently called him, went uncharacteristically silent today and saw his 28-game hitting streak snapped by the <a href="../teams/team_71.html">Gallant Juniors</a>. Moore was bailed out by the rest of the Juniors, however, who stopped the Juniors, 4-2.<br><br>The 17-year-old second baseman finished the day 0-for-4, and told reporters at the postgame press conference that "everybody did their job but me."<br><br>"Not that it was a huge problem -- we still won the game," he said with a grin. "The streak was a good run though. I'll try to start another one tomorrow."<br><br>Presently <a href="../players/player_2136.html">Moore</a> is batting .404 with no home runs and 35 RBIs. He has played in 40 games and scored 37 times.
