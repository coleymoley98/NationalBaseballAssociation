						Spring training usually means one thing. A lot of fresh young faces hopefully grabbing a piece of the show while they can. Whether destined to be future all-stars or just grabbing a cup of coffee, it is a time to see a much wider variety of talent on any club's roster.<br><br>However, this spring there is still one very familiar face lingering in the crowded clubhouse each day. 42-year-old <a href="../players/player_214.html">Ryan Verville</a> will be on the field this season to continue his long-tenured career. Ever the stickler for improvement, he joked with the press, "I have a lot to work on if I'm going to make it in the big leagues."<br><br>His manager added, "It's always great to see a player who still wants to bother with spring training after so many of them."<br><br>The New York Rebels have hopes that he grabs a regular role in their lineups and provides leadership to the clubhouse. When asked if we should expect to see him again next spring he replied, "I don't make plans that far in advance without asking my wife first."
