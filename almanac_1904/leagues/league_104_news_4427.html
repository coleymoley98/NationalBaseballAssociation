						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Thursday, June 5th, 1902</span><br>
						<a href="../players/player_1707.html">Émile Cormier</a> was on quite a roll today as he knocked the ball all over Juniors Ballpark, collecting 5 hits. His day of glory wasn't able to win the game, however. The <a href="../teams/team_80.html">New Britain Juniors</a> got the 9-8 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_77.html">Morgantown Juniors</a>.<br><br>"I never realized that a few hits could cause so much commotion," the first baseman said in the clubhouse after the game, crowded by reporters. "Headlines and highlights are great, but it takes a lot of luster off it that we lost."<br><br>After his first couple of hits, all eyes in the ballpark were on him each time <a href="../players/player_1707.html">Cormier</a> stepped into the batter's box. Even some opposing fans were pulling for him, knowing they were watching a little slice of baseball history unfold. <br><br>When asked what the secret of hitting so well is, he smiled and said "relax, concentrate, and hit the ball where they ain't." <br><br>That's exactly what he did today, as Cormier finished the game with 5 hits in 7 at-bats and a line in the record book. <a href="../players/player_1707.html">Émile Cormier</a> hit an RBI triple in the 1st, struck out in the 3rd, hit an RBI double in the 5th, flied out in the 7th, tripled in the 9th, singled in the 10th and singled in the 13th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_1707.html">Cormier</a> is hitting .545 in 1902 with 2 RBIs and no home runs.
