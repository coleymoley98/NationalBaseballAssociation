						After a 5-hit effort to lead <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal</a>'s 7-6 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a>,  left fielder <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a> told BNN beat writers it had been "a special day."<br><br>"It really doesn't matter whether it's sandlot ball, high school or college, two hits in a game is nice," he said. "Three or four is better, but five or more is out of sight. And to do that at the National League-level is really something special." <br><br>The 23-year-old player earned his accolades today at Montreal Grounds with a spectacular 5-for-6 game against the Lions. <br><br>"His swing is getting there," said Royales skipper Charles Read, who spoke glowingly of <a href="../players/player_739.html">Bouchard</a> after the game. "We want him to be quick with his swing, short and compact. We want him to be patient and go the other way when he can. <a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan</a> did that to perfection today." <br><br><a href="../players/player_739.html">Stéphan Bouchard</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, hit an RBI single in the 8th, flied out in the 9th and hit an RBI double in the 11th.<br><br>So far this year <a href="../players/player_739.html">Bouchard</a> has no home runs and a .314 batting average.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_384.html">View Boxscore</a>
