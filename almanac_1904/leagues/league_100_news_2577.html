						<a href="../players/player_48.html">William Pierre</a> has had his share of conversations with various news sources since becoming aware his name is coming up in recent trade talks. In his recent interview, he indicated he was through talking about it.<br><br>"It's hard enough when you find out from someone else a team may not feel you're worth keeping. It's harder yet when you have to keep talking about it and everyone keeps getting it wrong. I'm done. Now you have a reason to say some of things you already have said about me."<br><br>With that, Pierre left the hall outside of the locker room, shutting the door behind him.<br><br>Sources close to Pierre say he'd felt betrayed by reports that were portraying him as angry, short-tempered, and unwilling to divulge much about his future with Philadelphia. <br><br>Hunter Jones, a <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia Liberty</a> reliever, who knows him as well as anyone remarked, "Look, it's not my place to be saying anything about his status with the team, but I will say he doesn't take it lightly when he gets misquoted, or described as cold or uncaring."
