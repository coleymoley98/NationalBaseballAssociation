						Quebec closer <a href="../players/player_216.html">James McDade</a> may miss a week's worth of games due to a clubhouse prank gone wrong. According to teammates, <a href="../players/player_1013.html">Timmy Méthot</a> decided to try and give McDade a fright by donning a mask and sneaking up on him in the shower. The prank worked. Unfortunately for the Nordiques, it worked a little too well. McDade apparently was so startled by the intrusion that he instinctively flung his arm around to defend himself and unintentionally hit his hand against the shower knob. McDade sustained a laceration to his hand, which required several stitches, as well as a bruised thumb. "James was surprisingly good-natured about the incident," said manager Frédéric Lévesque. "Nonetheless, he'll be out for the next few games and that's gonna hurts us." Lévesque declined to say whether Méthot would be disciplined for the prank, but says he does believe he is sincerely remorseful for what happened. "I know Timmy feels worse about it than anyone, but I'll have to decide whether or not that's suf<br>ficient punishment. Either way, we'll handle the matter privately."
