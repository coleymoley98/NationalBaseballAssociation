						With the Canadian League draft only 90 days away, scouts across the league will have to finalize their priorities and focus hard on who they can realistically get. It's make or break time for these sabermetrical speculators, for they will ultimately be held to task if a "can't miss' player turns out to be a dud. League officials have made copies available for all league clubs in a new section of the Transactions page.<br><br>Teams now have a chance to scout the draft pool for 90 days before the draft is held.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_1931.html">Daniel Glaive</a>, 17 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1963.html">Vilas Promrak</a>, 17 year-old SS out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1485.html">Ronald Rice</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_1286.html">Wes Malone</a>, 21 year-old LF out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1255.html">Emrick Dagenais</a>, 21 year-old 2B out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1259.html">Justin Toppin</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1522.html">Chatchawal Srithong</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_1746.html">Dermot Pilkington</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_696.html">Adrian Laflamme</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1792.html">Conley Millage</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
