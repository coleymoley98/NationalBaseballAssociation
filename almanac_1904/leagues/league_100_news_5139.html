						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Friday, August 7th, 1903</span><br>
						Canadian League announced the 1903 amateur draft pool today, a scant 90 days in advance of the actual draft. For scouts, it is the toughest challenge of the season, trying to come up with an educated guess as to what a young man in his late teens or early twenties is going to do at the professional level a good five years down the road, at best. Some will go on gut instincts; some will rely on years of experience; but most will find it disconcerting how much their team is beholden to Lady Luck. Choose well and they are geniuses; choose poorly and they are unemployed.<br><br>A complete rundown of the draft list is available in the Transactions area for quick reference and will be available 90 days before the draft.<br><br>The early favorites to be high picks are the following:<br>1. <a href="../players/player_1672.html">James Belton</a>, 20 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_1961.html">Jimmy Michell</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1914.html">Isariya Auer</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_2058.html">Ron Vigil</a>, 17 year-old RHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1548.html">Tossakorn Weangsong</a>, 21 year-old SS out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_1723.html">Christopher Berglin</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_1964.html">Bobby Hatakeda</a>, 18 year-old CF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_2011.html">Terry Juneau</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_1688.html">Jakrit Petersen</a>, 20 year-old LHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1669.html">Sarawut St-Onge</a>, 20 year-old RF out of college.<br><br>The official OSA Mock Draft will be released on the day of the draft, or you can review the draft pool on the draft page.
