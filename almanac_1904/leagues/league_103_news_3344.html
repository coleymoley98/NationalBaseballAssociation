						After a 5-hit effort to lead <a href="../teams/team_84.html">Sainte-Paul</a>'s 16-4 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_90.html">Montreal Juniors</a>,  second baseman <a href="../players/player_1632.html">Newin Vézina</a> told BNN beat writers it had been "a special day."<br><br>"It really doesn't matter whether it's sandlot ball, high school or college, two hits in a game is nice," he said. "Three or four is better, but five or more is out of sight. And to do that at the Francophone Junior Circuit-level is really something special." <br><br>The 17-year-old player earned his accolades today at Ballpark of Montreal with a spectacular 5-for-6 game against the Juniors. <br><br>"His swing is getting there," said Juniors skipper J.J. Aubut, who spoke glowingly of <a href="../players/player_1632.html">Vézina</a> after the game. "We want him to be quick with his swing, short and compact. We want him to be patient and go the other way when he can. <a href="../players/player_1632.html">Newin</a> did that to perfection today." <br><br><a href="../players/player_1632.html">Newin Vézina</a> singled in the 1st, tripled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_1248.html">Haji Dubuc</a> in the 7th, struck out in the 8th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>Currently <a href="../players/player_1632.html">Vézina</a> is hitting .379 and has collected 7 home runs, 31 RBIs and scored 35 times, while playing in 36 games.
