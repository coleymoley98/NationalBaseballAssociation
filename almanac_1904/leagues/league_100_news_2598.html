						<a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto</a> hurler <a href="../players/player_827.html">Adam Watson</a> put his name in the league record book today at Canadian League Park I when he struck out his 120th batter of the year, thus erasing the previous single-season record set by <a href="../players/player_2.html">Piyawat Konchok</a>. The historic performance received a loud, standing ovation from the fans and both ball teams. At the press conference after the game was asked the secret of his strikeout success. Always good with an answer, <a href="../players/player_827.html">Watson</a> glibly replied, "I just rare back and throw it!" Strikeout victim number 120 was proud of his achievement, too. He told reporters, "<a href="../players/player_827.html">Watson</a> gave me no chance. He just blew it by me. But it's an honor. I'll have another paragraph in all the baseball books."<br><br>So far this year <a href="../players/player_827.html">Watson</a> has made 32 starts, tossed 276 innings, struck out 120 batters and walked 76. His record is 19-10 with a 2.35 ERA and he has limited opposing teams to a .249 batting average.
