						It's not something you read about in the sports pages every day -- a 5-for-7 day. For many, it might come around only once in a career -- and for <a href="../players/player_2081.html">Gerard DiPaolo</a>, it came around today. <br><br>The 17-year-old left fielder scattered hits all over Juniors Ballpark to pace the <a href="../teams/team_70.html">Minneapolis Juniors</a> to a 10-8 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_85.html">Quebec City Juniors</a>. <br><br><a href="../teams/team_85.html">Quebec City</a> skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_120.html">Leomar Durán</a> told reporters in the press room that "DiPaolo deserves a hat-tip."<br><br>"He hit some good pitches against us," he said. "In fact, according to our scouting reports, DiPaolo hit several that he is not supposed to be able to hit." <br><br><a href="../players/player_2081.html">Gerard DiPaolo</a> singled in the 1st, grounded out in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, singled in the 5th, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_2051.html">Shaun Bethard</a> in the 7th, grounded out in the 9th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_2049.html">Byron Brackens</a> in the 11th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_2081.html">DiPaolo</a> has collected a .339 batting average to date with 41 hits in 121 at-bats, 17 RBIs, 5 home runs and scored 35 times. He has played in 31 games.
