						While baseball is just getting underway again, one player is finding himself in the news for an increasingly rare reason - playing past the age of 40.<br><br>Detroit Lions' 3B, <a href="../players/player_263.html">Milkman Smith</a>, has bucked the odds and reported to camp, quelling many rumors that claimed he was just postponing his retirement until the last second for media attention.<br><br>"The media is full of it," the 41-year-old said with a laugh. "I still love the game and I'll play until I can't anymore. They'll have to pry the bat out of my cold dead hands."<br><br><a href="../players/player_263.html">Smith</a>'s teammates are getting a kick out of his insistence to play, going as far as bringing in walkers and wheelchairs to assist him in the clubhouse.
