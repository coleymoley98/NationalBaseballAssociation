The brash right-hander, who is known for a confidence that sometimes borders on arrogance, told reporters afterward that he "was the best pitcher in the league today."<br><br>Philadelphia skipper Anisong Ilic said in his postgame interview that Che-moh "tossed a masterpiece today."<br><br>"Hafit likes to talk but it ain't bragging if you can back it up," he said. "Today he certainly did just that."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1456.html">Che-moh</a> has made 14 starts so far this year and put up a 7-6 won-lost record with a 3.91 ERA.
