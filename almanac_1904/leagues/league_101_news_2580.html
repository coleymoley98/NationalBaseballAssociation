						Royales third baseman <a href="../players/player_221.html">Prasarn Heemkhao</a> had his way with <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a> pitching today at Montreal Grounds and mauled them for 5 hits in 5 at-bats. His efforts were all in vain, though, as the Lions ruined his great day by toppling the Royales, 8-7. <br><br>"I had a great day, but you've got to give <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit</a> credit, they did what they had to do to win," he told reporters after the game. "They weren't very impressed with my 5 hits." <br><br>"Oh, we noticed what <a href="../players/player_221.html">Heemkhao</a> did today," Lions skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_57.html">Enzo Kelly</a> said. "He had quite a game. I can tell you this, we will pitch him a little differently the next time we face him."<br><br><a href="../players/player_221.html">Prasarn Heemkhao</a> hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_77.html">Kittiphan Mai</a> in the 2nd, doubled in the 4th, doubled in the 6th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>Heemkhao is batting .316 this year with 3 home runs, 43 RBIs and 48 runs scored. He has 107 hits in 339 at-bats.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_400.html">View Boxscore</a>
