						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, July 4th, 1900</span><br>
						It doesn't happen very often, but it did for <a href="../players/player_1156.html">Aawut Chithathairat</a> today -- a 5-hit effort. He went on a rampage at Juniors Ballpark and paced the Juniors to a 20-2 win over the <a href="../teams/team_75.html">Fort Wayne Juniors</a>.<br><br>After his dynamite batting performance, the <a href="../teams/team_78.html">Quincy</a> catcher told reporters that he "just tried to get in a good count and have a good at-bat. That's all I can control."<br><br>His philosophy paid dividends today. He slammed 5 hits in 5 tries and put his name in the record book. <a href="../players/player_1156.html">Aawut Chithathairat</a> hit an RBI double in the 1st, walked in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, hit a two-run single in the 5th, singled in the 7th, singled in the 8th and walked in the 9th.<br><br>Chithathairat is hitting .356 this year with 1 home run, 18 RBIs and 19 runs scored. He has 37 hits in 104 at-bats, 17 walks and a .452 on-base percentage. <a href="../players/player_1156.html">Chithathairat</a> has played in 30 games.
