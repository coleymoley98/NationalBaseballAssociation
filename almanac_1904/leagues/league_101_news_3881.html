						It was a hits blitz for <a href="../players/player_462.html">Xavier Forget</a> at Bennett Park today.<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a> first baseman tore into the <a href="../teams/team_7.html">Detroit Lions</a> for 5 hits in 6 at-bats, but it wasn't enough to win the game. The Lions swept past the Nordiques 16-15 to ruin Forget's day.<br><br>"We weren't locating our pitches well," Quebec manager Frédéric Lévesque explained after the game. "Once you get behind in the count, you have to make really good pitches, rather than pretty good pitches, and we weren't able to do that today. Getting 5 hits from Xavier was nice but it wasn't enough."<br><br><a href="../players/player_462.html">Xavier Forget</a> tripled in the 2nd, doubled in the 3rd, doubled in the 6th, singled in the 7th, grounded out in the 8th and hit an RBI triple in the 9th. <br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_462.html">Forget</a> is batting .329 with 26 hits, no home runs, 12 RBIs, 3 walks, .361 OBP and has scored 13 runs.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_253.html">View Boxscore</a>
