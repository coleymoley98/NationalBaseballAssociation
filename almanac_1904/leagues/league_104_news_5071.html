						It was a good day for the Juniors at Juniors Ballpark as they clipped the <a href="../teams/team_75.html">Fort Wayne Juniors</a>, 15-13. It was tremendous day for <a href="../players/player_2215.html">Martin Preece</a>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-9. <br><br>"I don't know what to call that," the <a href="../teams/team_77.html">Morgantown</a> second baseman told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." <br><br><a href="../players/player_2215.html">Martin Preece</a> was hit by a pitch in the 2nd, flied out in the 3rd, tripled in the 5th, singled in the 7th, grounded out in the 8th, struck out in the 11th, singled in the 13th, singled in the 15th, flied out in the 15th and hit an RBI single in the 17th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_2215.html">Preece</a> is hitting at a .310 pace with 5 home runs and 23 RBIs. He has played in 40 games and scored 31 times.
