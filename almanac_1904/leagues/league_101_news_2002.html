						A jubilant <a href="../players/player_242.html">Hadji Jaja</a> joined the postgame press conference at Ballpark of Quebec today to offer some unusual words of encouragement -- for the <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou Frontenacs</a> pitching staff he had just vanquished.<br><br>"It may not have looked like it," said the <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Quebec Nordiques</a> third baseman, "but I saw some awful good pitches today. If luck hadn't been on my side it might have turned out a lot different." <br><br>That would not have been the conclusion of anyone who saw his dominant 5-for-5 hitting performance, which led the Nordiques to a 7-2 win.<br><br>"He made it look easy," said <a href="../coaches/coach_50.html">Nathaniel Forestier</a>, manager of the Frontenacs. "We never figured out what to do with him. Obviously."<br><br><a href="../players/player_242.html">Hadji Jaja</a> hit an RBI triple in the 1st, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th and hit a two-run single in the 8th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_242.html">Jaja</a> is batting .332 with 1 home run. He has scored 49 runs and driven in 54.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_359.html">View Boxscore</a>
