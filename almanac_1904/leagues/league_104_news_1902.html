						A jubilant <a href="../players/player_583.html">Duane Coontz</a> joined the postgame press conference at Hartford Grounds today to offer some unusual words of encouragement -- for the <a href="../teams/team_83.html">Hartford Juniors</a> pitching staff he had just vanquished.<br><br>"It may not have looked like it," said the <a href="../teams/team_79.html">Providence Juniors</a> second baseman, "but I saw some awful good pitches today. If luck hadn't been on my side it might have turned out a lot different." <br><br>That would not have been the conclusion of anyone who saw his dominant 5-for-6 hitting performance, which led the Juniors to a 14-6 win.<br><br>"He made it look easy," said <a href="../coaches/coach_104.html">Amaret Therrien</a>, manager of the Juniors. "We never figured out what to do with him. Obviously."<br><br><a href="../players/player_583.html">Duane Coontz</a> hit an RBI single in the 1st, hit an RBI double in the 3rd, doubled in the 4th, grounded out in the 5th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>Looking at his season stats, <a href="../players/player_583.html">Coontz</a> has compiled a .300 batting average and a .391 on-base percentage, while hitting no home runs and driving in 3 runs.
