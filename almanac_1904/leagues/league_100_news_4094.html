						The no-hitter is one of baseball's truly egalitarian achievements. It's done by the great and the not-so-great alike, and for nearly all of them it represents the pinnacle of a career. <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Boston Redcoats</a> pitcher <a href="../players/player_775.html">Jocelyn Fontaine</a> had his moment today at Exposition Park, holding the <a href="../teams/team_4.html">Philadelphia Liberty</a> hitless and beating them, 9-2.<br><br>"Everything was working for him," Liberty manager <a href="../coaches/coach_72.html">Anisong Ilic</a> said. "He had a lot of late movement that seemed to cause the guys trouble, especially from the fifth inning on.  He was in command."<br><br>Fontaine rung up 3 strikeouts, issued 5 walks and faced only 36 hitters in his historic outing. After the game, he spoke to BNN reporters in the Boston locker room.<br><br>"I really got nervous in the last inning," Fontaine recalled. "I knew I had a chance at a no-hitter but it was hard to stay calm and concentrate. Thank goodness for my catcher. He told me he would do all the thinking and I could just concentrate on hitting his glove."<br><br>For the year <a href="../players/player_775.html">Fontaine</a> has a 10-4 record with a 2.22 ERA in 15 starts.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_180.html">View Boxscore</a>
