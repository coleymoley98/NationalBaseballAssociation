						The scouting reports are in. Baseball officials have spent endless hours, days and weeks debating and agonizing over which first-year players should be drafted. Some guys do it scientifically, while the grizzled old pros go by gut feel. Whatever the team's philosophy, the Canadian League amateur draft is today and these ballclubs have the first five selections: <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou</a>, <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal</a>, <a href="../teams/team_1.html">Toronto</a>, <a href="../teams/team_3.html">New York</a> and <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Boston</a>. It is the consensus among the baseball journalists and experts that these guys will go in the first ten picks:<br><br><br>1. <a href="../players/player_599.html">Zachary Royer</a>, 21 year-old RHP out of college.<br>2. <a href="../players/player_714.html">Jake Dieckmann</a>, 21 year-old LF out of college.<br>3. <a href="../players/player_1093.html">Roger McLarty</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>4. <a href="../players/player_999.html">Reuban Seals</a>, 18 year-old LHP out of college.<br>5. <a href="../players/player_1059.html">Chongrak LaPorte</a>, 18 year-old 2B out of college.<br>6. <a href="../players/player_991.html">Ben Newman</a>, 18 year-old LF out of college.<br>7. <a href="../players/player_692.html">Karl Tisserand</a>, 21 year-old LF out of college.<br>8. <a href="../players/player_1099.html">Gordon Robillard</a>, 18 year-old RF out of college.<br>9. <a href="../players/player_431.html">Mikos Humphrey</a>, 22 year-old RHP out of college.<br>10. <a href="../players/player_1070.html">Pat Eagan</a>, 18 year-old RHP out of college.
