						The opening day of CL free agency arrives today with a flurry of activity as players file their paperwork to become free agents.<br><br>For the next several months, players and their prospective suitors will be locked in fierce negotiations. Deals will come together, fall apart and be resurrected again. Teams will fight to meet their needs while staying within their budget. Throughout the process, there will be second-guessing from fans and media alike. Even players who remain under contract will keep an eye on things, curious as to who will be sharing their locker room in the coming season and whether that bodes well or ill for their own careers.<br><br>Months from now, when the free agency period has settled down, fans will finally get a glimpse at the latest version of their team.<br><br>A number of quality players have filed for free agency and could generate a lot of interest.
