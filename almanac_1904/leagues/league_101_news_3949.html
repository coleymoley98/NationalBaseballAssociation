						<a href="../players/player_512.html">William Davison</a> was on quite a roll today as he knocked the ball all over West Side Grounds, collecting 5 hits. His day of glory wasn't able to win the game, however. The <a href="../teams/team_8.html">Montreal Royales</a> got the 6-3 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_6.html">Chicagou Frontenacs</a>.<br><br>"I never realized that a few hits could cause so much commotion," the shortstop said in the clubhouse after the game, crowded by reporters. "Headlines and highlights are great, but it takes a lot of luster off it that we lost."<br><br>After his first couple of hits, all eyes in the ballpark were on him each time <a href="../players/player_512.html">Davison</a> stepped into the batter's box. Even some opposing fans were pulling for him, knowing they were watching a little slice of baseball history unfold. <br><br>When asked what the secret of hitting so well is, he smiled and said "relax, concentrate, and hit the ball where they ain't." <br><br>That's exactly what he did today, as Davison finished the game with 5 hits in 5 at-bats and a line in the record book. <a href="../players/player_512.html">William Davison</a> tripled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>So far in 1901 Davison is batting .426 with 3 home runs, 11 RBIs and 17 runs scored. He has 43 hits in 101 at-bats and a .448 OBP.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_312.html">View Boxscore</a>
